S|	OPEN ON: ICE.

N|	We're underwater looking up at it. A saw cuts through,
N|	heading right for us.


S|	EXT. SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS -- DUSK

N|	ICE HARVESTERS, dressed in traditional Sami clothing, score a
N|	frozen lake. They SING.

M|				"The Frozen Heart (Ice Worker's Song)"

M|				ICE HARVESTERS
M|				BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR
M|				AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING,
M|				THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR
M|				HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.

N|	The men drag giant ice blocks through channels of water.

M|				ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
M|				CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.
M|				STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.

M|				SEE THE BEAUTY SHARP AND SHEER.
M|				SPLIT THE ICE APART!
M|				AND BREAK THE FROZEN HEART.
M|				Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

N|	A young Sami boy, KRISTOFF (8), and his reindeer calf, SVEN,
N|	share a carrot as they try to keep up with the men.

M|				ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
M|				Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

N|	Young Kristoff struggles to get a block of ice out of the
N|	water. He fails, ends up soaked. Sven licks his wet cheek.

M|				ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
M|				BEAUTIFUL! POWERFUL! DANGEROUS! COLD!
M|				ICE HAS A MAGIC CAN'T BE CONTROLLED.

N|	A sharp ice floe overtakes the workers, threateningly. They
N|	fight it back.

M|				ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
M|				STRONGER THAN ONE, STRONGER THAN TEN
M|				STRONGER THAN A HUNDRED MEN!

N|	Massive fjord horses drag heavy ice plows.

M|				ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
M|				BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR
M|				AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING

N|	The sun sets. Lanterns are lit.

M|				ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
M|				THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR
M|				HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.
M|				CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.

N|	In the dark, Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single
N|	block of ice out of the water.

M|				ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
M|				STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.
M|				THERE'S BEAUTY AND THERE'S DANGER HERE.
M|				SPLIT THE ICE APART!
M|				BEWARE THE FROZEN HEART.

N|	The workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it
N|	pulls away.

N|	Left behind, Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a
N|	dinky little sled then head off.

N|	We sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the
N|	sky...then move across the mountains...beneath the
N|	snowline...and descend upon...


S|	EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- NIGHT

N|	A humble castle, built of wood, nestled in a deep fjord.


S|	INT. CASTLE, NURSERY -- NIGHT

N|	ELSA (8) sleeps in her bed. Her little sister ANNA (5) pops
N|	up beside her.

M|				YOUNG ANNA
M|				Elsa. Psst. Elsa! Psst.

N|	Elsa doesn't stir. Anna sits on Elsa and bounces.

M|				YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

M|				YOUNG ELSA
M|				(grumbling)
M|				Anna, go back to sleep.

N|	Anna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on Elsa.
M|				3
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				YOUNG ANNA
M|				(drama queen-ish)
M|				I just can't. The sky's awake, so
M|				I'm awake, so we have to play.

M|				YOUNG ELSA
M|				...Go play by yourself.

N|	Elsa shoves Anna off the bed.

N|	Anna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated. But then she gets
N|	an idea. She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsa's
N|	eyelids.

M|				YOUNG ANNA
M|				(mischievously)
M|				Do you want to build a snowman?

N|	Elsa's eyes both pop open. She smiles.


S|	INT. CASTLE STAIRCASE -- NIGHT

N|	Anna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand.

M|				YOUNG ANNA
M|				Come on, come on, come on, come on.

N|	Elsa tries to shush her, but Anna's too excited.


S|	INT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT

N|	The girls sneak into the ballroom. Elsa shuts the door.

M|				YOUNG ANNA
M|				Do the magic! Do the magic!

N|	Elsa laughs and waves her hands together. Snowflakes suddenly
N|	burst forth and dance between her palms, forming a snowball.
N|	Elsa throws the snowball high into the air. Snow bursts out
N|	and flurries around the room. Anna dances about, catching
N|	flakes in her palms and mouth.

M|				YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				This is amazing!

M|				YOUNG ELSA
M|				Watch this!

N|	Elsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice
N|	suddenly coats the floor, forming a giant ice rink. Anna
N|	slides off, laughing.

D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



S|	PLAY MONTAGE:

N|	-Anna and Elsa roll giant snowballs and build a snowman
N|	together. Elsa moves his stick arms around.

M|				YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				(goofy voice)
M|				Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

N|	Anna jumps up and hugs him.

M|				YOUNG ANNA
M|				I love you, Olaf.

N|	-Anna and Olaf appear to be dancing. REVEAL: Elsa is actually
N|	propelling them across the ice floor with her magic.

N|	-The girls slide down snowbanks together!

N|	-Anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air.

M|				YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Catch me!

N|	Elsa makes another peak to catch Anna.

M|				YOUNG ELSA
M|				Gotcha!

N|	Anna keeps jumping. Elsa keeps casting magic.

M|				YOUNG ANNA
M|				(jumping faster)
M|				Again! Again!

M|				YOUNG ELSA
M|				(struggling to keep up)
M|				Slow down!

N|	Elsa suddenly slips.

N|	Her magic accidentally STRIKES Anna in the head. Anna tumbles
N|	down a snowbank and lands, unconscious.

M|				YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				ANNA!

N|	Elsa runs to Anna and takes her in her arms. A streak of
N|	Anna's hair, where struck, turns white.

M|				YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				MAMA! PAPA!

N|	The room around them fills with frightening ice spikes.
M|				5
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	The parents burst through the frozen door. GASP at the sight
N|	of the room.

M|				KING
M|				Elsa, what have you done? This is
M|				getting out of hand!

M|				QUEEN
M|				(seeing Anna)
M|				Anna!

N|	The King and Queen rush to Anna and take her in their arms.

M|				ELSA
M|				It was an accident. I'm sorry,
M|				Anna.

M|				QUEEN
M|				(about Anna)
M|				She's ice cold.

M|				KING
M|				...I know where we have to go.

M|				SLAM CUT TO:


S|	INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT

N|	The King sifts through a shelf to find an ancient book
N|	inscribed with Old Norse runes. He opens the book, scrambles
N|	to a page with an ancient map.


S|	EXT. ARENDELLE -- NIGHT

N|	Carrying the girls, the King and Queen ride their horses out
N|	of the kingdom. Snow streams from Elsa's hands, leaving a
N|	trail of ice behind them.


S|	EXT. FJORD MOUNTAIN FOREST -- NIGHT

N|	A sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark
N|	woods. All of a sudden, the King and Queen race by with the
N|	girls, leaving the wake of ice.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Ice?

M|				SLAM CUT TO:
M|				6
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



S|	EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

N|	Kristoff rides Sven as they follow the trail of ice.

M|				YOUNG KRISTOFF
M|				Faster, Sven!


S|	EXT. THE VALLEY OF THE LIVING ROCK -- NIGHT

N|	Kristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley. They
N|	hide behind a rock and peek out.

N|	Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa. The Queen holds
N|	the still unconscious Anna.

M|				KING
M|				Please, help. My daughter!

N|	Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward
N|	them. It looks as though they'll be crushed!

N|	But, luckily, the rocks stop at their feet. The rocks then
N|	unfold, revealing bright faces.

M|				YOUNG KRISTOFF
M|				Trolls...?

N|	The rock in front of Kristoff "wakes up." Meet BULDA.

M|				BULDA
M|				Shush. I'm trying to listen.

N|	She grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them
N|	close. Sven licks her face and she eyes them both.

M|				BULDA (CONT'D)
M|				Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.

N|	Back below, the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth.
N|	They call him GRAND PABBIE. He approaches arthritically, but
N|	determined. He nods respectfully to the king.

M|				GRAND PABBIE
M|				Your Majesty.
M|				(referring to Elsa)
M|				Born with the powers or cursed?

M|				KING
M|				Born. And they're getting stronger.

N|	Grand Pabbie motions for the Queen to bring Anna to him. She
N|	does. He examines her.
M|				7
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				GRAND PABBIE
M|				(about Anna)
M|				You are lucky it wasn't her heart.
M|				The heart is not so easily changed,
M|				but the head can be persuaded.

M|				KING
M|				Do what you must.

M|				GRAND PABBIE
M|				I recommend we remove all magic,
M|				even memories of magic to be
M|				safe.... But don't worry, I'll
M|				leave the fun.

N|	Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Anna's
N|	head. We see her memories floating right above her. Grand
N|	Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary
N|	memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their
N|	nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the
N|	girls in winter gear. He puts the ordinary memories back in
N|	her head.

M|				GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)
M|				She will be okay.

M|				YOUNG ELSA
M|				But she won't remember I have
M|				powers?

M|				KING
M|				It's for the best.

M|				PABBIE
M|				Listen to me, Elsa, your power will
M|				only grow.

N|	As he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a
N|	silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes.

M|				PABBIE (CONT'D)
M|				There is beauty in your magic....
M|				But also great danger.

N|	The snowflakes turn to sharp spikes.

M|				PABBIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
M|				You must learn to control it.

N|	In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human
N|	figures to panic and attack Elsa.

M|				PABBIE (CONT'D)
M|				Fear will be your enemy.
M|				8
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Elsa gasps and buries her face in the King's chest. The King
N|	wraps his arms around Elsa, protectively.

M|				KING
M|				No. We'll protect her. She can
M|				learn to control it. I'm sure.

N|	Over the King's words we...

M|				DISSOLVE TO:

N|	-The Arendelle castle gates shutting.

M|				KING (O.S.) (CONT'D)
M|				Until then, we'll lock the gates.
M|				We'll reduce the staff. We will
M|				limit her contact with people and
M|				keep her powers hidden from
M|				everyone... including Anna.

N|	-The castle shutters close.

N|	-Anna sits on her bed as Elsa's furniture disappears.

N|	-Anna rushes to the hall to see Elsa shut the door to her new
N|	room. Anna watches, confused and sad.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:


S|	INT. CASTLE WINDOW -- DAY

N|	We look out on a gentle snowfall. Little Anna skips up to the
N|	window. She lights up at the sight of the snow and rushes
N|	down the hall.


S|	INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR -- DAY

N|	Anna knocks on Elsa's door and SINGS.

M|				"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"

M|				YOUNG ANNA
M|				DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?
M|				COME ON LET'S GO AND PLAY.

N|	Anna peeks under the door.

M|				YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				I NEVER SEE YOU ANYMORE.
M|				COME OUT THE DOOR.
M|				IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GONE AWAY.
M|				9
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	-INT. ANNA'S ROOM -- Anna plays with two dolls, gives up, sad.

M|				YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				WE USED TO BE BEST BUDDIES
M|				AND NOW WE'RE NOT.
M|				I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME WHY.

N|	-ELSA'S DOOR. Anna peeks through the key hole.

M|				YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

N|	-Anna calls through the keyhole.

M|				YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SNOWMAN.

M|				YOUNG ELSA (O.S.)
M|				Go away, Anna.

M|				YOUNG ANNA
M|				(hearbroken)
M|				...OKAY BYE.

N|	-BEHIND THE DOOR -- DAY. Elsa sits at the window looking out,
N|	longingly. Suddenly, her icy hands freeze the windowsill.

N|	-LATER. The King slips leather gloves onto Elsa's hands.

M|				KING
M|				The gloves will help.

N|	He pats her gloved hand.

M|				KING (CONT'D)
M|				See? You're good....
M|				(starting their mantra)
M|				Conceal it.

M|				YOUNG ELSA
M|				Don't feel it.

M|				YOUNG ELSA & KING
M|				Don't let it show.

N|	-INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR -- DAY. Anna, now 9, knocks on
N|	Elsa's door.

M|				ANNA (9)
M|				DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

N|	-INT. HALLWAY -- DAY. Alone, Anna rides a bicycle built for
N|	two in the hall by standing on the back seat.
M|				10
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
M|				OR RIDE OUR BIKE AROUND THE HALL?
M|				I THINK SOME COMPANY IS OVERDUE...

N|	-INT. PORTRAIT ROOM -- DAY. Anna runs around the portrait
N|	room, gaining momentum to flip over the arm of the couch.

M|				ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
M|				I'VE STARTED TALKING TO
M|				THE PICTURES ON THE WALLS.

N|	Anna lands PLOP on the cushions, then looks up at the
N|	painting above her of the courageous Joan of Arc.

M|				ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
M|				Hang in there, Joan.

N|	-INT. EMPTY LIBRARY -- DAY. Looks like no one's around.

M|				ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
M|				IT GETS A LITTLE LONELY
M|				ALL THESE EMPTY ROOMS.

N|	But then we find Anna, laying at the base of the grandfather
N|	clock, playing with her braids, bored out of her mind.

M|				ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
M|				JUST WATCHING THE HOURS TICK BY.

N|	Anna's eyes follow the grandfather clock's pendulum.

M|				ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
M|				TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK.

N|	-INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- NIGHT. Elsa (now 12) paces as she panics.
N|	The entire wall is frozen behind her.

M|				ELSA (12)
M|				I'm scared. It's getting stronger.

M|				KING
M|				Getting upset only makes it worse.

N|	The King goes to hug her.

M|				ELSA (12)
M|				No. Don't touch me. I don't want to
M|				hurt you.

N|	He and the Queen look at each other with alarmed sadness.

N|	-INT. LIBRARY -- DAY. Anna, now a teenager, slides past Elsa's
N|	room without stopping.
M|				11
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	-INT. KING AND QUEEN'S QUARTERS -- DAY. Anna runs into the
N|	room and throws herself into her parents' arms.

M|				TEEN ANNA
M|				See you in two weeks.

N|	-INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- DAY. Elsa curtsies in front of her
N|	parents, formally, not touching them.

M|				TEEN ELSA
M|				Do you have to go?

M|				KING
M|				You'll be fine, Elsa.

N|	-EXT. DOCKS -- DAY. The King and Queen leave on a ship.

N|	-EXT. ROUGH SEAS -- NIGHT. Lightning flashes. The sea rages in
N|	a storm. The King and Queen's ship is lost in the waves.

N|	-INT. CASTLE -- DAY. A portrait of the King and Queen is
N|	covered in mourning cloth.

N|	-EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY. Anna looks small, standing before her
N|	people, beside burial stones.

N|	-INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR. Anna, still in her mourning
N|	clothes, approaches and knocks.

M|				ANNA
M|				(singing)
M|				Elsa? PLEASE I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE
M|				PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHERE YOU'VE BEEN
M|				THEY SAY HAVE COURAGE
M|				AND I'M TRYING TO
M|				I'M RIGHT OUT HERE FOR YOU.
M|				PLEASE LET ME IN.

N|	Anna slides down the door and sits with her head against it.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER.
M|				IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.
M|				WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
M|				(weak, internal)
M|				DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

N|	We move through the door...

N|	-INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- DAY. Elsa is sitting in the exact same
N|	pose as Anna. Her bedroom is frozen with ice. Snowflakes hang
N|	in the air, suspended by grief.

M|				FADE OUT.
M|				12
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



S|	EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- MORNING

N|	A new dawn rises over the fjords.

N|	Ships pull up to the docks. Guests pile out.

M|				DOCK MASTER
M|				Welcome to Arendelle!

N|	A BOY tries to get away as his MOTHER tries to stuff him in
N|	his bunad jacket.

M|				BOY
M|				Why do I have to wear this?

M|				MOTHER
M|				Because the Queen has come of age.
M|				It's Coronation Day!

M|				BOY
M|				That's not my fault.

N|	They pass the May Pole being raised and a Sami ice harvester
N|	chatting with his reindeer. We recognize them as Kristoff and
N|	Sven, all grown up. Sven hops around excitedly like a dog and
N|	nuzzles Kristoff's chest.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				What do you want, Sven?

N|	Kristoff leans in and speaks for Sven, as if he can.

M|				KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
M|				Give me a snack.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				What's the magic word?

M|				KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
M|				Please!

N|	Kristoff pulls a carrot out of his shirt pocket and hands it
N|	to Sven. Sven tries to bite the whole thing.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Hey, hey, hey! Share!

N|	Sven takes a smaller bite. Kristoff then has a bite himself,
N|	not seeming to care that it's covered in reindeer slobber.

N|	We move on to PERSI and AGGIE, a super-excited couple who
N|	rush towards the castle.
M|				13
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				PERSI
M|				I can't believe they're finally
M|				opening up the gates!

M|				AGGIE
M|				And for a whole day! Faster, Persi!

N|	They pass a tiny but menacing DUKE, who wears taps on his
N|	shoes to "enhance" his presence. Two THUG guards follow close
N|	behind him.

M|				DUKE
M|				Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious
M|				trade partner. Open those gates so
M|				I may unlock your secrets and
M|				exploit your riches.
M|				(catching himself)
M|				...Did I just say that out loud?

N|	We leave him and head down the bridge towards the castle
N|	gates, passing an Irishman and a Spanish Dignitary.

M|				IRISHMAN
M|				Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to see
M|				the Queen and the Princess. I bet
M|				they're absolutely lovely.

M|				SPANISH DIGNITARY
M|				I bet they are beautiful.

N|	We move past them, to a particular castle window.

M|				CUT TO:


S|	INT. CASTLE, ANNA'S BEDROOM -- DAY

N|	Anna, 18, snores. Drools. KNOCK. KNOCK.

M|				KAI (O.S.)
M|				Princess Anna...?

N|	Anna sits up. She's got major bedhead. She coughs. Snorts.
N|	Pulls a hair from her mouth.

M|				ANNA
M|				...Huh? Yeah?

M|				KAI (O.S.)
M|				Sorry to wake you, ma'am but--

M|				ANNA
M|				No, you didn't. I've been up for
M|				hours.
M|				14
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	She falls back asleep while sitting. She snores. Her head
N|	drops, startling her awake.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Who is it?

M|				KAI (O.S.)
M|				It's still me, ma'am. Time to get
M|				ready.

M|				ANNA
M|				Ready for what?

M|				KAI (O.S.)
M|				Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

M|				ANNA
M|				My sister's cor-neration...

N|	One eye opens enough to catch sight of her coronation dress.
N|	She bolts, wide awake in excitement.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Coronation Day! Ha ha!

M|				SLAM CUT TO:


S|	EXT. CASTLE HALL -- DAY

N|	Anna bursts out of her room, wearing her coronation dress.
N|	She finishes pinning ribbons in her hair. Seeing the hustle
N|	and bustle of preparations, she can't help but SING.

M|				"For the First Time in Forever"

M|				ANNA
M|				THE WINDOW IS OPEN!
M|				SO'S THAT DOOR!
M|				I DIDN'T KNOW THEY DID THAT ANYMORE.
M|				WHO KNEW WE OWNED 8000 SALAD PLATES...?

N|	-Anna slides along the floor of the ballroom in her socks.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				FOR YEARS I HAVE ROAMED THESE EMPTY HALLS
M|				WHY HAVE A BALLROOM WITH NO BALLS?
M|				FINALLY, THEY'RE OPENING UP THE GATES!

N|	-She shakes hands with a suit of armor. Breaks it. Hides the
N|	evidence.
M|				15
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				THERE'LL BE REAL, ACTUAL PEOPLE -
M|				IT'LL BE TOTALLY STRANGE.
M|				BUT WOW AM I SO READY FOR THIS CHANGE!

N|	-Anna comes to a window and jumps out onto a window washer's
N|	pulley. She raises herself up to see the ships arriving.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
M|				THERE'LL BE MUSIC, THERE'LL BE LIGHT.
M|				FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
M|				I'LL BE DANCING THROUGH THE NIGHT.

N|	-Anna walks through the garden and follows a family of geese.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				DON'T KNOW IF I'M ELATED OR GASSY,
M|				BUT I'M SOMEWHERE IN THAT ZONE
M|				'CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
M|				I WON'T BE ALONE.
M|				(speaking)
M|				I can't wait to meet everyone....
M|				(GASP) What if I meet THE ONE?

N|	-Anna twists herself in a velvet drape like it's a gown. She
N|	acts like she looks gorgeous, but she looks ridiculous.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				TONIGHT, IMAGINE ME GOWN AND ALL-
M|				FETCHINGLY DRAPED AGAINST THE WALL.
M|				THE PICTURE OF SOPHISTICATED GRACE.

N|	-She notices the bust of a man across the room.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				(google-eyed)
M|				I SUDDENLY SEE HIM STANDING THERE,
M|				A BEAUTIFUL STRANGER TALL AND FAIR.
M|				(mouth full of chocolate)
M|				I WANNA STUFF SOME CHOCOLATE IN MY
M|				FACE!

N|	-She grabs the bust of the man and swings it around.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				BUT THEN WE LAUGH AND TALK ALL EVENING,
M|				WHICH IS TOTALLY BIZARRE.
M|				NOTHING LIKE THE LIFE I'VE LED SO FAR.

N|	The bust goes flying and lands on the top of the cake.

N|	-Anna bursts into the portrait room, bounces on the
N|	furniture, and interacts with the paintings.
M|				16
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
M|				THERE'LL BE MAGIC, THERE'LL BE FUN.
M|				FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
M|				I COULD BE NOTICED BY SOMEONE.
M|				AND I KNOW IT IS TOTALLY CRAZY
M|				TO DREAM I'D FIND ROMANCE.
M|				BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
M|				AT LEAST I'VE GOT A CHANCE!

N|	-INT. LIBRARY. ELSA, now a very poised 21, watches out the
N|	window as the coronation guests arrive.

M|				ELSA
M|				DON'T LET THEM IN.
M|				DON'T LET THEM SEE.
M|				BE THE GOOD GIRL
M|				YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE.

N|	Elsa moves to a painting of her father's coronation. She
N|	takes off her gloves and mimics the painting by holding a
N|	candlestick and ornament in place of an orb and scepter.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				CONCEAL. DON'T FEEL.
M|				PUT ON A SHOW.
M|				MAKE ONE WRONG MOVE
M|				AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW.

N|	The candlestick and ornament ice over. Elsa gasps, slams them
N|	back down onto the table. She tries to reassure herself.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				BUT IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY.

N|	We cut between Anna's excitement and Elsa's nerves.

M|				ANNA
M|				IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY!

M|				ELSA
M|				IT'S AGONY TO WAIT.

M|				ANNA
M|				IT'S AGONY TO WAIT!!!

M|				ELSA
M|				TELL THE GUARDS TO OPEN UP THE GATE.

M|				ANNA
M|				THE GATE!!!

N|	-Finally, the gates are open! Anna moves through the crowd,
N|	admiring the people around her.
M|				17
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee

M|				ANNA                                   ELSA
S|	I'M GETTING WHAT I'M DREAMING          BE THE GOOD GIRL
S|	OF                                     YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

S|	A CHANCE TO LEAVE MY SISTER'S          CONCEAL.
S|	WORLD                                  CONCEAL. DON'T FEEL.
S|	A CHANCE TO FIND TRUE LOVE             DON'T LET THEM KNOW.

N|	-Anna hurries over the bridge and into the village square.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				I KNOW IT ALL ENDS TOMORROW,
M|				SO IT HAS TO BE TODAY!!
M|				`CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
M|				FOREVER. . .
M|				FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER!
M|				NOTHING'S IN MY WAY!!!

N|	-Anna SLAMS right into the breast of a HORSE!

N|	She falls back and lands in a small wooden boat. It tips off
N|	of the dock. She's heading overboard. But just then, the
N|	horse slams his hoof into the boat and steadies it.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				(frustrated)
M|				Hey!

M|				HANS
M|				I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

N|	The rider, HANS, sure is handsome and regal.

M|				ANNA
M|				(gentler)
M|				Hey. I-ya, no. No. I'm okay.

M|				HANS
M|				Are you sure?

M|				ANNA
M|				Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I
M|				was going. But I'm okay.

N|	He hops down from his horse and steps into the boat.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				I'm great, actually.

D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				HANS
M|				Oh, thank goodness.

N|	He offers her a hand and their eyes meet. Chemistry. He helps
N|	her to her feet.

M|				HANS (CONT'D)
M|				(bowing)
M|				Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

M|				ANNA
M|				(curtseying)
M|				Princess Anna of Arendelle.

M|				HANS
M|				Princess...? My Lady.

N|	He drops to his knees, head bowed. The horse bows too,
N|	curling his hoof up and out of the boat.

N|	The boat tips. Hans tumbles on top of Anna. Awkward.

M|				ANNA
M|				Hi...again.

N|	The horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it.
N|	Anna and Hans tumble the other way. Anna lands on top of him.

M|				HANS
M|				Oh boy.

M|				ANNA
M|				Ha. This is awkward. Not you're
M|				awkward, but just because we're--
M|				I'm awkward. You're gorgeous.
M|				(did she just say that?)
M|				Wait, what?

N|	Hans quickly gets to his feet and helps Anna up again.

M|				HANS
M|				I'd like to formally apologize for
M|				hitting the Princess of Arendelle
M|				with my horse...and for every
M|				moment after.

M|				ANNA
M|				No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT
M|				Princess. I mean, if you'd hit my
M|				sister Elsa, that would be-- yeash!
M|				`Cuz, you know...
M|				(patting the horse)
M|				Hello.

D|			FROZEN - J. Lee

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				(to Hans)
M|				But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.

M|				HANS
M|				Just you?

N|	Hans smiles, amused. She smiles back. The bells RING. She
N|	doesn't notice at first; she's too busy drinking in Hans's
N|	handsomeness.

M|				ANNA
M|				...The bells. The coronation. I-I-I
M|				better go. I have to...I better go.

N|	She hurries off, stops, turns back. Gives Hans a little wave.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Bye!

N|	As she rushes off again, Hans waves back. The horse waves
N|	too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat.

M|				HANS
M|				Oh no.

N|	The boat falls, with Hans in it. SPLASH! It lands upside down
N|	in the water. Hans raises it up off of him, gasping for air.

M|				CUT TO:

S|	INT. CHURCH CHAPEL -- DAY

N|	Elsa stands at the alter. Anna stands off to one side. She
N|	peeks out to the audience.

N|	Hans waves at her from the pews. He's changed his clothes.

N|	The crown is placed on Elsa's head. The scepter and orb are
N|	presented to Elsa on a pillow. She slowly reaches for them.

M|				BISHOP
M|				(a whisper)
M|				Your Majesty, the gloves.

N|	Elsa hesitates. She breathes nervously, removes her gloves,
N|	places them on the pillow. Her hands shake. She takes the orb
N|	and scepter, then turns to the people.

M|				BISHOP (CONT'D)
M|				(formal, in Old Norse)
M|				Sehm hon HELL-drr IN-um HELL-gum

D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	The scepter and orb start to freeze over.

M|				BISHOP (CONT'D)
M|				...Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

M|				CROWD
M|				Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

N|	Just in time. Elsa manages to set the orb and scepter back
N|	down on the pillow before anyone notices the ice. She picks
N|	up her gloves and slips them on. She made it.

M|				CUT TO:


S|	INT. GREAT HALL -- NIGHT

N|	Springy music fills the Great Hall. Guests dance. Eat. Laugh.

S|	TRUMPETS SOUND.

M|				KAI
M|				(announcing)
M|				Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

N|	Elsa enters, poised and looking surprisingly content. She
N|	stands under a formal awning.

M|				KAI (CONT'D)
M|				Princess Anna of Arendelle!

N|	Anna runs into the room, waves awkwardly. Kai ushers her over
N|	to stand right next to Elsa.

M|				ANNA
M|				Here? Are you sure?

N|	She and Elsa sneak awkward peeks at each other.

M|				ELSA
M|				...Hi.

M|				ANNA
M|				Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.

M|				ELSA
M|				...You look beautiful.

M|				ANNA
M|				Thank you. You look beautifuller. I
M|				mean, not fuller. You don't look
M|				fuller, but more beautiful.
M|				21
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ELSA
M|				Thank you.

N|	They look out at the celebration.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				So, this is what a party looks
M|				like?

M|				ANNA
M|				It's warmer than I thought.

M|				ELSA
M|				And what is that amazing smell?

N|	They both close their eyes and inhale.

M|				ANNA AND ELSA (TOGETHER)
M|				...Chocolate.

N|	Their eyes pop open. They laugh.

N|	Elsa looks back out at the party. Anna looks at Elsa. She
N|	wants to say so much, but she can't think of where to start.
N|	Just as she finds her way, Kai interrupts.

M|				KAI
M|				Your Majesty. The Duke of
M|				Weaseltown.

M|				DUKE
M|				Weselton. The Duke of Weselton.
M|				(to Elsa)
M|				Your Majesty, as your closest
M|				partner in trade, it seems only
M|				fitting that I offer you your first
M|				dance as queen.

N|	The Duke does a funny flitter of his feet, a hitch-kick, and
N|	a deep bow.

M|				DUKE (CONT'D)
M|				(whispers to himself)
M|				One, two, three. Jump.

N|	As he holds out his hand, head down, his toupee dips forward.
N|	Anna giggles. Elsa looks at Anna, stifles a giggle herself.

M|				ELSA
M|				(to the Duke)
M|				Thank you...only I don't dance.
M|				22
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				DUKE
M|				(offended)
M|				Oh...?

M|				ELSA
M|				But my sister does.

M|				ANNA
M|				What?

M|				DUKE
M|				Lucky you....

M|				ANNA
M|				Oh, I don't think--

N|	The Duke grabs Anna's arm and yanks her away before she can
N|	protest.

M|				DUKE
M|				If you swoon, let me know, I'll
M|				catch you.

N|	Anna looks back at Elsa, desperately.

M|				ELSA
M|				Sorry.

N|	OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR: The Duke showboats, but he's just
N|	awful. Anna tries to make the best of it.

M|				DUKE
M|				Like an agile peacock... CLUCK-
M|				CLUGGLE-CLUCK!

N|	He lands on her feet.

M|				ANNA
M|				Ow. Ow.

M|				DUKE
M|				Speaking of, so great to have the
M|				gates open. Why did they shut them
M|				in the first place? Do you know the
M|				reason? Hmm?

N|	He gets in her face, suspicious.

M|				ANNA
M|				...No.
C|						23
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				DUKE
M|				Oh, all right. Hang on. They don't
M|				call me the little dipper for
M|				nothing.

N|	He dips Anna back. Elsa peeks through the crowd, can barely
N|	hold in her laughter. Anna shoots Elsa funny, help-me looks.

M|				DUKE (CONT'D)
M|				(groove fully on)
M|				Like a chicken...with the face of a
M|				monkey...I fly.

M|				JUMP CUT TO:


S|	MOMENTS LATER...

N|	Anna limps back to Elsa.

M|				DUKE (O.S.)
M|				Let me know when you're ready for
M|				another round, M'Lady.

M|				ELSA
M|				Well, he was sprightly.

M|				ANNA
M|				(rubbing her sore feet)
M|				Especially for a man in heels.

M|				ELSA
M|				Are you okay?

M|				ANNA
M|				(loving Elsa's attention)
M|				I've never been better. This is so
M|				nice. I wish it could be like this
M|				all the time.

M|				ELSA
M|				(sincere)
M|				Me too....

N|	But then Elsa catches herself. She stiffens up, looks away.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				But it can't.

M|				ANNA
M|				Why not? If--

M|				ELSA
M|				It just can't.
M|				24
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Anna's smile drops. She tries not to get emotional.

M|				ANNA
M|				Excuse me for a minute.

N|	She walks away. Elsa watches her go, saddened.

N|	Moving through the crowd, Anna gets bumped by a bowing man's
N|	butt. She falls. Just before she hits the floor, Hans catches
N|	her. He smiles perfectly.

M|				HANS
M|				Glad I caught you.

M|				ANNA
M|				Hans.

N|	He smoothly sets his drink down on a passing tray. He lifts
N|	her up and leads her in a romantic dance.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:

N|	LATER: Anna and Hans drink and chat.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				I often had the whole parlor to
M|				myself to slide... Oops. Sorry.

N|	She hits him in the face by mistake with her hand. He laughs.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:

N|	-THE CASTLE DOORS: Anna and Hans stroll out of the castle.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				...Your physique helps I'm sure.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:

N|	-THE ROSE GARDEN... Hans notices her white streak.

M|				HANS
M|				(about her white streak)
M|				What's this?

M|				ANNA
M|				I was born with it, although I
M|				dreamt I was kissed by a troll.

M|				HANS
M|				I like it.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:

D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



S|	EXT. BALCONY -- NIGHT

N|	Anna teaches Hans how to eat krumkake.

M|				ANNA
M|				Yeah, the whole thing! You got it.

N|	They laugh as the krumkake crumbles in his face.

M|				ANNA(CONT'D)
M|				Okay wait, wait. So you have how
M|				many brothers?

M|				HANS
M|				Twelve older brothers. Three of
M|				them pretended I was invisible...
M|				literally...for two years.

M|				ANNA
M|				That's horrible.

M|				HANS
M|				It's what brothers do.

M|				ANNA
M|				...And sisters. Elsa and I were
M|				really close when we were little.
M|				But then, one day she just shut me
M|				out, and I never knew why.

N|	He takes her hand. Leans in close.

M|				HANS
M|				I would never shut you out.

M|				ANNA
M|				Okay, can I just say something
M|				crazy?

M|				HANS
M|				I love crazy.

M|				"Love is an Open Door"

M|				ANNA
M|				(singing)
M|				ALL MY LIFE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF
M|				DOORS IN MY FACE.
M|				AND THEN SUDDENLY I BUMP INTO YOU.

M|				HANS
M|				I was thinking the same thing,
M|				because like. . .

M|				HANS (CONT'D)
M|				I'VE BEEN SEARCHING MY WHOLE LIFE
M|				TO FIND MY OWN PLACE.
M|				AND MAYBE IT'S THE PARTY TALKING,
M|				OR THE CHOCOLATE FONDUE.

M|				ANNA
M|				BUT WITH YOU-

M|				HANS
M|				BUT WITH YOU,
M|				I FOUND MY PLACE.

M|				ANNA
M|				I SEE YOUR FACE.

M|				BOTH
M|				AND IT'S NOTHING LIKE I'VE EVER
M|				KNOWN BEFORE.

N|	They jump to the neighboring balcony and enter a door.

N|	They come out on top of one of the castle's towers.

M|				BOTH (CONT'D)
M|				LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR!
M|				LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR!

N|	Cut to them sliding across an empty hallway in their socks.

M|				BOTH (CONT'D)
M|				LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR

M|				ANNA
M|				WITH YOU!

M|				HANS
M|				WITH YOU!

M|				ANNA
M|				WITH YOU!

M|				HANS
M|				WITH YOU!

M|				BOTH
M|				LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR.

N|	They hop up on the castle roof and watch a shooting star.

M|				HANS
M|				I MEAN IT'S CRAZY.

M|				ANNA
M|				What?
M|				27
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				HANS
M|				WE FINISH EACH OTHER'S-

M|				ANNA
M|				SANDWICHES!

M|				HANS
M|				That's what I was gonna say!

N|	They slide down the back of the roof out of sight.

N|	We next find them strutting on a bridge ledge.

M|				ANNA
M|				I'VE NEVER MET SOMEONE-

M|				BOTH
M|				WHO THINKS SO MUCH LIKE ME.

M|				BOTH (SPOKEN) (CONT'D)
M|				Jinx.. . .jinx again.

N|	Are they doing the robot? No. They're imitating the
N|	mechanical figures on the clock tower.

M|				BOTH (CONT'D)
M|				OUR MENTAL SYNCHRONIZATION
M|				CAN HAVE BUT ONE EXPLANATION,

M|				HANS
M|				YOU-

M|				ANNA
M|				AND I-

M|				HANS
M|				WERE-

M|				ANNA
M|				JUST-

M|				BOTH
M|				MEANT TO BE.

N|	Anna and Hans dance on top of the lighthouse and cast dancing
N|	shadows across the sails of ships in the docks.

M|				ANNA
M|				SAY GOODBYE-

M|				HANS
M|				SAY GOODBYE-
M|				28
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				BOTH
M|				TO THE PAIN OF THE PAST.

M|				BOTH (CONT'D)
M|				WE DON'T HAVE TO FEEL IT ANYMORE!
M|				LOVE IS AN OPEN-

N|	They play hide and seek amongst the stable doors.

M|				BOTH (CONT'D)
M|				DOOR! LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR!

N|	They climb to the waterfall looking out over the kingdom.

N|	Anna raises up her hands to frame the moon. Hans puts his
N|	hands on top of hers. Together their hands form a heart.

M|				BOTH (CONT'D)
M|				LIFE CAN BE SO MUCH MORE-

M|				ANNA
M|				WITH YOU!

S|	INT. BALL -- NIGHT

N|	Anna pushes through the crowd towards Elsa, Hans in tow.

M|				ANNA
M|				Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just
M|				get around you there? Thank you.
M|				Oh, there she is. Elsa!

N|	Elsa turns to Anna. Anna curtseys awkwardly.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				I mean...Queen.... Me again. Um.
M|				May I present Prince Hans of the
M|				Southern Isles.

M|				HANS
M|				(bowing)
M|				Your Majesty.

N|	Elsa gives a polite but reserved curtsey.

M|				ANNA
M|				We would like--

M|				HANS
M|				--your blessing--

M|				ANNA
M|				--of--

M|				ANNA/HANS
M|				--our marriage!

M|				ELSA
M|				Marriage...?

M|				ANNA
M|				Yes!

M|				ELSA
M|				I'm sorry, I'm confused.

M|				ANNA
M|				Well, we haven't worked out all the
M|				details ourselves. We'll need a few
M|				days to plan the ceremony. Of
M|				course we'll have soup, roast, and
M|				ice cream and then--
M|				Wait. Would we live here?

M|				ELSA
M|				Here?

D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				HANS
M|				Absolutely!

M|				ELSA
M|				Anna--

M|				ANNA
M|				Oh, we can invite all twelve of
M|				your brothers to stay with us--

M|				ELSA
M|				What? No, no, no, no, no.

M|				ANNA
M|				Of course we have the room. I don't
M|				know. Some of them must--

M|				ELSA
M|				Wait. Slow down. No one's brothers
M|				are staying here. No one is getting
M|				married.

M|				ANNA
M|				Wait, what?

M|				ELSA
M|				May I talk to you, please. Alone.

N|	Anna sees Hans's worried face. Hooks arms with him.

M|				ANNA
M|				No. Whatever you have to say, you-
M|				you can say to both of us.

M|				ELSA
M|				Fine. You can't marry a man you
M|				just met.

M|				ANNA
M|				You can if it's true love.

M|				ELSA
M|				Anna, what do you know about true
M|				love?

M|				ANNA
M|				More than you. All you know is how
M|				to shut people out.

M|				ELSA
M|				You asked for my blessing, but my
M|				answer is no. Now, excuse me.

D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				HANS
M|				Your Majesty, if I may ease your--

M|				ELSA
M|				(flustered)
M|				No, you may not. And I-I think you
M|				should go.

N|	Elsa walks away. As she passes the Royal Handler--

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				The party is over. Close the gates.

M|				ANNA
M|				What? Elsa, no. No, wait!

N|	Anna grabs Elsa's hand. She pulls off Elsa's glove. Elsa
N|	gasps, spins around and reaches for the glove in panic.

M|				ELSA
M|				Give me my glove!

N|	Anna holds the glove away from Elsa.

M|				ANNA
M|				(desperate)
M|				Elsa, please. Please. I can't live
M|				like this anymore.

N|	Elsa fights tears.

M|				ELSA
M|				(weak)
M|				...Then leave.

N|	Elsa sees Anna's hurt face. It's too much. She can't hold it
N|	in. She turns and rushes away.

M|				ANNA
M|				(heartbroken)
M|				...What did I ever do to you?!

N|	The party goes silent as everyone watches the sisters.

M|				ELSA
M|				Enough, Anna.

M|				ANNA
M|				No. Why? Why do you shut me out?!
M|				Why do you shut the world out?!
M|				What are you so afraid of?!

M|				ELSA
M|				I said, enough!

N|	Ice shoots from Elsa's hand, spikes across the floor! Guests
N|	cry out in shock, back away.

M|				DUKE
M|				(ducking behind his men)
M|				...Sorcery. I knew there was
M|				something dubious going on here.

M|				ANNA
M|				Elsa...?

N|	Elsa rushes out of the room.

M|				CUT TO:


S|	EXT. COURTYARD -- NIGHT

N|	Elsa bursts out of the castle door. The CITIZENS CHEER!

M|				CROWD
M|				There she is. Your Majesty! Long
M|				live the Queen! Queen Elsa.... Come
M|				drink with us.

N|	Elsa ducks through the crowd, holding her bare hand.

M|				BOWING TOWNSMAN
M|				Queen Elsa.

M|				TOWNSWOMAN WITH BABY
M|				Your Majesty? Are you all right?

N|	Elsa backs away from the baby. She knocks into the fountain,
N|	grabs its edge. The waters freeze at her touch.

N|	GASPS of shock and fear sweep over the crowd.

N|	The Duke and thugs come out the door.

M|				DUKE
M|				There she is! Stop her!

M|				ELSA
M|				(to the Duke)
M|				Please, just stay away from me.
M|				Stay away!

N|	Magic accidentally shoots from her hand and turns the
N|	staircase into ice. The thugs and the Duke fall.

M|				DUKE
M|				Monster.... Monster!
M|				33
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	The crowd panics.

N|	A snowstorm begins. Elsa flees.

N|	Anna runs out of the palace doors, carrying the glove.

M|				ANNA
M|				Elsa!

N|	Hans follows closely behind her.

N|	GATES TO THE KINGDOM: Elsa runs out of the gates and down to
N|	the water's edge. The shoreline freezes under her feet.

N|	Anna calls to her from the gates.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Elsa! Wait, please!

N|	Elsa glances back at Anna, but turns away. She tentatively
N|	steps out onto the fjord. It freezes instantly. She breaks
N|	into a run, as the water freezes over with each step.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Elsa, stop!

N|	Anna rushes out onto the fjord ice, slips, falls.

M|				HANS
M|				Anna!

N|	Hans rushes to Anna's side.

N|	Elsa reaches the far shore. She doesn't look back. She just
N|	scrambles into the mountains.

M|				ANNA
M|				No.

M|				HANS
M|				(shocked)
M|				Look.... The fjord.

N|	The ice spreads out until the entire fjord is frozen, locking
N|	the ships in place.


S|	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- NIGHT

N|	Snow falls. Hans and Anna move through the panicking crowd.

M|				CROWD WALLAH
M|				Snow? It's...snow...in July.

D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				HANS
M|				...Are you all right?

M|				ANNA
M|				(in shock)
M|				No.

M|				HANS
M|				Did you know?

M|				ANNA
M|				No.

N|	Nearby, the Duke flutters about in fright.

M|				DUKE
M|				Look! It's snowing! It's snowing!
M|				The Queen has cursed this land! She
M|				must be stopped!
M|				(to his thugs)
M|				You have to go after her.

N|	Anna rushes up to the Duke.

M|				ANNA
M|				Wait, no!

N|	The Duke hides behind his thugs and points out at Anna.

M|				DUKE
M|				You! Is there sorcery in you, too?
M|				Are you a monster, too?

M|				ANNA
M|				No. No. I'm completely ordinary.

M|				HANS
M|				That's right she is...
M|				(realizing how that
M|				sounds)
M|				...in the best way.

M|				ANNA
M|				...And my sister's not a monster.

M|				DUKE
M|				She nearly killed me.

M|				HANS
M|				You slipped on ice.

M|				DUKE
M|				Her ice!
M|				35
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA
M|				It was an accident. She was scared.
M|				She didn't mean it. She didn't mean
M|				any of this.... Tonight was my
M|				fault. I pushed her. So I'm the one
M|				that needs to go after her.

M|				DUKE
M|				Yes. Fine. Do.

M|				HANS
M|				What?

M|				ANNA
M|				(to the Royal Handler)
M|				Bring me my horse, please.

M|				HANS
M|				Anna, no. It's too dangerous.

M|				ANNA
M|				Elsa's not dangerous. I'll bring
M|				her back, and I'll make this right.

N|	The Royal Handler brings Anna her horse and a cloak.

M|				HANS
M|				I'm coming with you.

M|				ANNA
M|				No, I need you here to take care of
M|				Arendelle.

N|	He sees the desperation in her eyes.

M|				HANS
M|				...On my honor.

N|	She throws on the cloak and hops right onto the horse,
N|	coronation dress and all.

M|				ANNA
M|				(to the crowd)
M|				I leave Prince Hans in charge!

M|				HANS
M|				(before letting her go)
M|				Are you sure you can trust her? I
M|				don't want you getting hurt.

M|				ANNA
M|				She's my sister; she would never
M|				hurt me.
M|				36
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	She snaps the reins and rides out. Hans watches after her.

N|	The snow picks up and overtakes our view. We push through a
N|	blizzard...lose our way...then finds ourselves...


S|	EXT. HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

N|	Well above the snow-line, a small figure climbs the highest
N|	peak. It's Elsa. Finally, she stops, looks around. Catches
N|	her breath and sings...

M|				"Let It Go"

M|				ELSA
M|				THE SNOW GLOWS WHITE
M|				ON THE MOUNTAIN TONIGHT,
M|				NOT A FOOTPRINT TO BE SEEN.
M|				A KINGDOM OF ISOLATION
M|				AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M THE QUEEN.

M|				THE WIND IS HOWLING
M|				LIKE THIS SWIRLING STORM INSIDE.
M|				COULDN'T KEEP IT IN,
M|				HEAVEN KNOWS I TRIED. . .

M|				DON'T LET THEM IN,
M|				DON'T LET THEM SEE,
M|				BE THE GOOD GIRL YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO
M|				BE.
M|				CONCEAL,
M|				DON'T FEEL,
M|				DON'T LET THEM KNOW.
M|				WELL, NOW THEY KNOW.

N|	Elsa takes off her glove and throws it into the air.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				LET IT GO. LET IT GO.
M|				CAN'T HOLD IT BACK ANYMORE.

N|	Elsa creates a snowman, just like the one she made with Anna
N|	when they were children.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				LET IT GO. LET IT GO.
M|				TURN AWAY AND SLAM THE DOOR.
M|				I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO
M|				SAY.
M|				LET THE STORM RAGE ON.
M|				THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.

N|	Elsa lets her cape fly back into the wind.
M|				37
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				IT'S FUNNY HOW SOME DISTANCE
M|				MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM SMALL.
M|				AND THE FEARS THAT ONCE CONTROLLED ME
M|				CAN'T GET TO ME AT ALL.
M|				IT'S TIME TO SEE
M|				WHAT I CAN DO,
M|				TO TEST THE LIMITS AND BREAK THROUGH.
M|				NO RIGHT, NO WRONG,
M|				NO RULES FOR ME...I'M FREE!

N|	Elsa creates ice steps and climbs them.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
M|				I AM ONE WITH THE WIND AND SKY.
M|				LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
M|				YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME CRY.
M|				HERE I STAND AND HERE I'LL STAY.

N|	Elsa slams her foot down and forms a giant snowflake.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				LET THE STORM RAGE ON....

N|	In a flurry of creative release, she raises the snowflake on
N|	ice beams, builds walls, archways, a glistening chandelier,
N|	and an intricate ceiling that leaves the sky visible.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				MY POWER FLURRIES THROUGH THE AIR
M|				INTO THE GROUND.
M|				MY SOUL IS SPIRALING IN FROZEN
M|				FRACTALS ALL AROUND.
M|				AND ONE THOUGHT CRYSTALLIZES LIKE
M|				AN ICY BLAST-

N|	Standing firmly in her mighty ice palace, Elsa removes her
N|	crown and throws it.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				I'M NEVER GOING BACK,
M|				(back to resolve)
M|				THE PAST IS IN THE PAST!

N|	She takes down her hair and creates a new dress made of ice.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
M|				AND I'LL RISE LIKE THE BREAK OF DAWN.
M|				LET IT GO! LET IT GO!

N|	The sun rises. Elsa struts onto out onto a balcony and into
N|	the light. She's free.
M|				38
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				THAT PERFECT GIRL IS GONE.
M|				HERE I STAND IN THE LIGHT OF DAY.
M|				LET THE STORM RAGE ON!!
M|				THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.

N|	She turns and slams her ice palace door on us.

M|				CUT TO:


S|	EXT. THE FJORD FOREST -- DAY

N|	Anna rides her horse through two feet of snow. She shivers.

M|				ANNA
M|				(shivering)
M|				Elsa! Elsa! It's me, Anna...your
M|				sister who didn't mean to make you
M|				freeze the summer. I'm sorry. It's
M|				all my f-f-f-f-f-f-fault.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:

N|	LATER: Anna and the horse struggle through a wooded area.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				(hearing a wolf howl)
M|				Of course, none of this would have
M|				happened if she'd just told me her
M|				secret...ha...she's a stinker.

N|	A branch of a nearby tree snaps and startles the horse. Anna
N|	goes flying off, lands face down in the snow. She sits up.
N|	Spits out snow. Sees the horse running away.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No.
M|				No. No. No.... Oooo-kay.

N|	He doesn't come back. Anna grabs onto a branch of a leaning
N|	conifer, tries to pull herself to her feet, but the tree
N|	snaps upright and releases all its snow onto her. GROAN.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:


S|	EXT. MOUNTAIN -- NIGHT

N|	The Northern Lights shine as Anna struggles, out of breath,
N|	reaching the top of a hill.
M|				39
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA
M|				Snow, it had to be snow, she
M|				couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical
M|				magic that covered the f-f-fjords
M|				in white sand and warm --

N|	She sees smoke rising up in the distance.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Fire! WHOA!

N|	Anna goes tumbling down the hill. She lands with a crash in
N|	an icy stream at the bottom.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				(from inside the snowball)
M|				Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold...


S|	EXT. A SMALL BUILDING AND STABLE -- NIGHT

N|	Anna shuffles up to the building, her dress frozen stiff. She
N|	shakes the snow off a sign and reads:

M|				ANNA
M|				Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.

N|	Snow drops off a smaller sign. She reads it, happily.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Ooh! And Sauna...


S|	INT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST & SAUNA -- NIGHT

N|	Anna steps cautiously through the door--which hits her frozen
N|	butt and knocks her into the center of the shop. She looks
N|	around, sees only summer supplies.

M|				OAKEN (O.S.)
M|				Hoo hoo.

N|	Anna turns to see a bright-faced fellow sitting low behind
N|	the counter, fingers tapping tip to tip.

M|				OAKEN (CONT'D)
M|				Big summer blow out. Half off
M|				swimming suits, clogs, and a sun
M|				balm of my own invention, yah?

M|				ANNA
M|				Oh, great. For now, how about
M|				boots. Winter boots...and dresses?
M|				40
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				OAKEN
M|				(slight disappointment)
M|				That would be in our winter
M|				department.

N|	The winter department contains one outfit, a pick ax, and a
N|	lonely pair of boots.

M|				ANNA
M|				Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has
M|				another young woman, the Queen
M|				perhaps, I don't know, passed
M|				through here?

N|	She brings the clothes and boots to the counter.

M|				OAKEN
M|				Only one crazy enough to be out in
M|				this storm is you, dear?

N|	The front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a
N|	man covered in ice. Underneath is KRISTOFF.

M|				OAKEN (CONT'D)
M|				You and this fellow.... Hoo hoo.
M|				Big summer blow out.

N|	Kristoff walks right up to Anna.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(in her face)
M|				Carrots.

M|				ANNA
M|				Huh?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Behind you.

M|				ANNA
M|				Oh, right. Excuse me.

N|	Anna moves out of Kristoff's way. He grabs a bunch of
N|	carrots, tosses them on the counter, then moves through the
N|	place, gathering other supplies.

M|				OAKEN
M|				(to Kristoff)
M|				A real howler in July, yah? Where
M|				ever could it be coming from?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				The North Mountain.
M|				41
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA
M|				(to herself)
M|				North Mountain.

N|	Kristoff brings his supplies to the counter. Oaken counts on
N|	his fingertips.

M|				OAKEN
M|				That'll be forty.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Forty? No, ten.

M|				OAKEN
M|				(sweet as pie)
M|				Oh dear, that's no good. See these
M|				are from our winter stock, where
M|				supply and demand have a big
M|				problem.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				You want to talk about a supply and
M|				demand problem? I sell ice for a
M|				living.

N|	Kristoff motions out the window, where we see the blocks of
N|	ice on his sled, covered in snow.

M|				ANNA
M|				Ooh, that's a rough business to be
M|				in right now. I mean, that is
M|				really...
M|				(he shoots her a look)
M|				Ahem. That's unfortunate.

M|				OAKEN
M|				Still forty. But I will throw in a
M|				visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo!
M|				Hi, family.

N|	Kristoff and Anna turn to see a naked family waving through
N|	the window of the steaming sauna.

M|				NAKED FAMILY
M|				Hoo hoo!

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				...Ten's all I got. Help me out.

M|				OAKEN
M|				(isolating the carrots)
M|				Ten will get you this and no more.

N|	Kristoff seethes. Stalemate.
M|				42
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA
M|				Okay, just tell me one thing; what
M|				was happening on the North
M|				Mountain? Did it seem magical?

N|	Kristoff pulls down his scarf and gives Anna a firm answer.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Yes! Now, back up while I deal with
M|				this crook here.

N|	Oaken stands up, revealing his seven-foot stature.

M|				OAKEN
M|				What did you call me?


S|	EXT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT

N|	Oaken stomps out the door, carrying Kristoff with one arm.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa!

N|	Oaken throws Kristoff, who face-plants in the snow.

M|				OAKEN
M|				Bye bye.

N|	Oaken slams the door. Kristoff sits up. His reindeer, Sven,
N|	canters over, snorts, and nudges him, expectantly.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

N|	Sven huffs in his face. Kristoff turns away and sees
N|	something. He points to a dilapidated barn.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				But I did find us a place to sleep.
M|				And it's free.


S|	INT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT

N|	Anna stands watching Oaken and all his great height as he
N|	squeezes behind the counter and sits down low again.

M|				OAKEN
M|				(teddy bear)
M|				I'm sorry about this violence. I
M|				will add a quart of lutefisk, so
M|				we'll have good feelings. Just the
M|				outfit and boots, yah?
M|				43
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Anna looks between Kristoff's supplies and the door.

M|				CUT TO:


S|	INT. OAKEN'S STABLES - NIGHT

N|	Kristoff, now unfrozen, relaxes on a bed of hay, playing his
N|	lute and singing to (and for) Sven.

M|				"Reindeer(s) are Better than People"

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				REINDEERS ARE BETTER THAN PEOPLE.
M|				SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?

M|				KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
M|				(throwing his voice)
M|				YEAH, PEOPLE WILL BEAT YOU & CURSE
M|				YOU & CHEAT YOU.
M|				EVERY ONE OF EM'S BAD, EXCEPT YOU.
M|				(speaking)
M|				Oh, thanks, Buddy.
M|				(singing, as Kristoff)
M|				BUT PEOPLE SMELL BETTER THAN
M|				REINDEERS.
M|				SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK I'M RIGHT?

M|				(As Sven)
M|				THAT'S ONCE AGAIN TRUE,
M|				FOR ALL EXCEPT YOU.
M|				(As Kristoff)
M|				YOU GOT ME. LET'S CALL IT A NIGHT.
M|				(As Sven)
M|				GOOD NIGHT.
M|				(As Kristoff)
M|				DON'T LET THE FROSTBITE BITE.

N|	The door opens. Anna enters.

M|				ANNA
M|				Nice duet.

N|	Kristoff sits up with a start...sees who it is.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Oh, it's just you. What do you
M|				want?

M|				ANNA
M|				I want you to take me up the North
M|				Mountain.
C|						44
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				KRISTOFF
M|				I don't take people places.

N|	He lays back down, closes his eyes.

M|				ANNA
M|				Let me rephrase that...

N|	A sack of supplies lands in Kristoff's lap.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Umph.

N|	He sits up. Looks in the bag.

M|				ANNA
M|				Take me up the North Mountain....
M|				Please.

N|	He eyes her. He clearly doesn't take orders.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Look, I know how to stop this
M|				winter.

N|	He considers, lies back down, pulls his hat over his eyes.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				We leave at dawn.... And you forgot
M|				the carrots for Sven.

N|	A bag of carrots hits Kristoff in the face.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Ugh!

M|				ANNA
M|				Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I
M|				didn't--
M|				(catching herself)
M|				We leave now. Right now.

N|	She steps back outside and waits, anxiously. Annoyed,
N|	Kristoff offers Sven a carrot. Sven has a bite. Then Kristoff
N|	has a bite, contemplating.

M|				SLAM CUT TO:


S|	EXT. MOUNTAIN HIGH -- NIGHT

N|	Sven races, top speed, up a narrow cliff, pulling the sled,
N|	which skids precariously. Kristoff mans the reins. Anna sits
N|	beside him.
M|				45
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(trying to scare Anna)
M|				Hang on! We like to go fast!

M|				ANNA
M|				(fearless)
M|				I like fast!

N|	Anna leans back and puts her feet up on the dashboard.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down.

N|	He pushes her feet down.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				This is fresh lacquer. Seriously,
M|				were you raised in a barn?

N|	Kristoff spits on the dash to clean it. The spit flies back
N|	and hits Anna in the face.

M|				ANNA
M|				(grossed out)
M|				Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.

N|	She wipes off her face.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				So tell me, what made the Queen go
M|				all ice-crazy?

M|				ANNA
M|				...Oh well, it was all my fault. I
M|				got engaged but then she freaked
M|				out because I'd only just met him,
M|				you know, that day. And she said
M|				she wouldn't bless the marriage--

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Wait. You got engaged to someone
M|				you just met?

M|				ANNA
M|				Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she
M|				got mad and then she tried to walk
M|				away, and I grabbed her glove--

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Hang on. You mean to tell me you
M|				got engaged to someone you just
M|				met?!
M|				46
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA
M|				Yes. Pay attention. But the thing
M|				is she wore the gloves all the
M|				time, so I just thought, maybe she
M|				has a thing about dirt.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Didn't your parents ever warn you
M|				about strangers?

N|	Anna eyes Kristoff up and down, then slides away from him.

M|				ANNA
M|				Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a
M|				stranger.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Oh yeah? What's his last name?

M|				ANNA
M|				...Of-the-Southern-Isles?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				What's his favorite food?

M|				ANNA
M|				...Sandwiches.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Best friend's name?

M|				ANNA
M|				Probably John.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Eye color.

M|				ANNA
M|				Dreamy.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Foot size...?

M|				ANNA
M|				Foot size doesn't matter.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Have you had a meal with him yet?
M|				What if you hate the way he eats?
M|				What if you hate the way he picks
M|				his nose?

M|				ANNA
M|				Picks his nose?
M|				47
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				KRISTOFF
M|				And eats it.

M|				ANNA
M|				Excuse me, sir. He's a prince.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				All men do it.

M|				ANNA
M|				Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's
M|				true love.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Doesn't sound like true love.

M|				ANNA
M|				Are you some sort of love expert?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				No. But I have friends who are.

M|				ANNA
M|				You have friends who are love
M|				experts.... I'm not buying it.

N|	Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(to Anna)
M|				Stop talking.

M|				ANNA
M|				No, no, no. I'd like to meet these--

N|	Kristoff clamps his hand over Anna's mouth.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				I mean it. SHHH.

N|	Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them.
N|	Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. Its
N|	light reflects off...EYES. Several.

M|				KRISTOFF(CONT'D)
M|				Sven, go. Go!

N|	Sven takes off.

M|				ANNA
M|				What are they?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Wolves.
M|				48
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Flashes of white dart through the woods. Kristoff hops into
N|	the back of the sled, grabs a torch. Lights it.

M|				ANNA
M|				Wolves. What do we do?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				I've got this. You just...don't
M|				fall off and don't get eaten.

M|				ANNA
M|				But I wanna help.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				No.

M|				ANNA
M|				Why not?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Because I don't trust your
M|				judgement.

M|				ANNA
M|				Excuse me?!

N|	A wolf jumps at them, but Kristoff kicks it off.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Who marries a man she just met?

N|	Anna grabs the lute, swings it right at Kristoff's head.

M|				ANNA
M|				It's true love!

N|	He screams, as she...BAM!...swings past Kristoff and knocks a
N|	wolf away.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(shocked)
M|				Whoa.

N|	Just then Kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf.
N|	The torch goes flying. Anna catches it, shocked.

M|				ANNA
M|				Christopher!

N|	Kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the
N|	sled and holds on for dear life as he's dragged behind.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				It's Kristoff!
M|				49
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	A wolf jumps on Kristoff's back.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				AH!

N|	Anna thinks fast, uses the torch to light a blanket on fire.

M|				ANNA
M|				Duck!

N|	Anna throws the flaming blanket right at him. He ducks. The
N|	blanket hits the wolves. They tumble off Kristoff.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				You almost set me on fire!

N|	Anna reaches out a hand, pulls Kristoff back onto the sled.

M|				ANNA
M|				But I didn't.

N|	Sven cries out. There is a massive gorge ahead.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Get ready to jump, Sven!

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				You don't tell him what to do!

N|	Kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				I do!

N|	Kristoff tosses Anna onto Sven, then unhooks Sven's harness
N|	from the sled.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Jump, Sven!

N|	Sven jumps the gorge with Anna on his back.

N|	Kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled.

N|	Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge.

N|	Kristoff's sled loses momentum. It's not going to make it. He
N|	leaps off. He flaps his arms, claws at the air.

N|	He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff. Hanging by his
N|	hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below
N|	and burst into flames.
M|				50
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				(shocked sadness)
M|				...But I just paid it off.

N|	Suddenly, he starts to slip. He claws at the loose snow, but
N|	it's clearly hopeless. He's going down.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Uh-oh. No, no, no.

N|	To make matters worse, an AXE comes flying right at his face.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				AH! NO, NO, NO!

N|	The axe slams into the snow, inches from his nose.

M|				ANNA (O.S.)
M|				Grab on!

N|	Kristoff grabs on.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Pull, Sven! Pull!

N|	REVEAL: The axe is tied to a rope, then wrapped around Sven.
N|	Anna helps Sven pull Kristoff to safety.

N|	Kristoff rolls onto his back, exhausted. Anna peeks down at
N|	the burning sled.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Whoa.... I'll replace your sled and
M|				everything in it.

N|	Kristoff groans.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				And I understand if you don't want
M|				to help me anymore.

N|	Anna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Of course I don't want to help her
M|				anymore. In fact, this whole thing
M|				has ruined me for helping anyone
M|				ever again.

M|				KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
M|				But she'll die on her own.

M|				KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D)
M|				I can live with that.
M|				51
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Through their conversation, they watch Anna go the wrong
N|	way...turn, go the other wrong way, turn, trip...

M|				KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
M|				But you won't get your new sled if
M|				she's dead.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				(knowing he's got a point)
M|				...You know sometimes I really
M|				don't like you.

N|	Sven licks Kristoff happily.

M|				KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D)
M|				(to Anna)
M|				Hold up. We're coming?!

M|				ANNA
M|				(excited)
M|				You are?!
M|				(catching herself)
M|				I mean, sure. I'll let you tag
M|				along.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:

S|	EXT. SHARP MOUNTAIN RIDGE -- DAWN

N|	Kristoff, Sven and Anna walk on a narrow rim of a mountain.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:


S|	EXT. MOUNTAIN FOREST CLEARING -- DAY

N|	As they step out of the thick trees, Anna catches sight of
N|	something far below.

M|				ANNA
M|				Arendelle.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				It's completely frozen.

M|				ANNA
M|				...But it'll be fine. Elsa will
M|				thaw it.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Will she?
M|				52
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA
M|				(uncertain)
M|				...Yeah. Now come on. This way to
M|				the North Mountain?

N|	She points straight ahead.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				More like this way.

N|	He points her finger up towards a perilously mighty mountain.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:


S|	INT. FROZEN WILLOW TREES -- DAY

N|	Anna, Kristoff, and Sven walk beneath frozen willows. The
N|	hanging branches glisten like Christmas lights. Sven knocks
N|	them with his antlers. They tinkle like chimes.

M|				ANNA
M|				I never knew winter could be so
M|				beautiful.

N|	Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere. We'll call that
N|	voice OLAF.

M|				OLAF (O.S.)
M|				YEAH...It really is beautiful,
M|				isn't it? But it's so white. You
M|				know, how about a little color?
M|				Must we bleach the joy out of it
M|				all? I'm thinking like maybe some
M|				crimson, chartreuse...

N|	While this is going on, Anna and Kristoff look around for the
N|	source of the rambling. They look at Sven - could he actually
N|	be talking? Sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in
N|	branches, just as baffled as they are.

N|	In the meantime, a nose-less snowman, Olaf, wanders up behind
N|	them.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				How `bout yellow--no, not yellow.
M|				Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go.

N|	He stops between Kristoff and Anna. They look down at him.
N|	How did he get there? He suddenly looks up at Anna.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				Am I right?
M|				53
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Anna SCREAMS! Reflexes take over and she kicks Olaf's head,
N|	sending it flying off his body and into Kristoff's arms.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				(cheery, to Kristoff)
M|				Hi!

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				You're creepy.

N|	Kristoff tosses the head back to Anna and they commence a
N|	game of hot potato.

M|				ANNA
M|				I don't want it!

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Backatchya!

M|				OLAF
M|				Please don't drop me.

M|				ANNA
M|				Don't!

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Come on, it's just a head.

M|				ANNA
M|				No!

N|	Olaf's body runs at Anna, arms waving.

M|				OLAF (O.S.)
M|				All right, we got off to a bad
M|				start.

M|				ANNA
M|				Ew, ew, the body!

N|	Anna slams Olaf's head back on the body, upside down. Olaf
N|	smiles happily, then looks confused.

M|				OLAF
M|				Wait, what am I looking at right
M|				now? Why are you hanging off the
M|				earth like a bat?

M|				ANNA
M|				(sympathetic)
M|				...Okay. Wait one second.

N|	Anna kneels in front of Olaf and rights his head.
M|				54
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				OLAF
M|				Oooh! Thank you!

M|				ANNA
M|				You're welcome.

M|				OLAF
M|				Now I'm perfect.

N|	She looks over his innocent face, gets an idea.

M|				ANNA
M|				Well, almost.

N|	She digs into Kristoff's satchel, holds up a carrot just as
N|	Olaf turns toward her. The carrot accidentally slams all the
N|	way through his head.

M|				OLAF
M|				Woo! Head rush!

M|				ANNA
M|				Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I-I, I was
M|				just.... Are you okay?

N|	Olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his
N|	eyes. He lights up.

M|				OLAF
M|				Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!
M|				I've always wanted a nose.
M|				(going cross-eyed to look
M|				at his tiny nose)
M|				So cute. It's like a little baby
M|				unicorn.

N|	Anna reaches behind Olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking
N|	out the back of his head, and pushes it forward.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				What? Hey! Whoa.
M|				(seeing his now big nose)
M|				Oh, I love it even more! Hah....
M|				All right, let's start this thing
M|				over. Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I
M|				like warm hugs.

N|	Olaf opens his arms wide to Anna. That triggers a memory. It
N|	takes her a moment to place it, but then she does.

M|				ANNA
M|				Olaf?...That's right, Olaf.
M|				55
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				OLAF
M|				...And you are?

M|				ANNA
M|				Oh, um...I'm Anna.

M|				OLAF
M|				And who's the funky-looking donkey
M|				over there?

M|				ANNA
M|				That's Sven.

M|				OLAF
M|				Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?

M|				ANNA
M|				...Sven.

N|	Olaf looks from Kristoff to Sven, confused.

M|				OLAF
M|				Oh. They're--oh, okay....
M|				(accepting it)
M|				Makes things easier for me.

N|	Sven tries to bite Olaf's nose.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss
M|				my nose.
M|				(gushes)
M|				I like you, too!

M|				ANNA
M|				Olaf, did Elsa build you?

M|				OLAF
M|				Yeah. Why?

N|	Curious, Kristoff takes one of Olaf's twig arms off, studies
N|	it. It seems to be moving in sync with his other arm.

M|				ANNA
M|				Do you know where she is?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(studying the arm)
M|				Fascinating...

M|				OLAF
M|				Yeah. Why?
C|						56
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA
M|				Do you think you could show us the
M|				way?

M|				OLAF
M|				Yeah. Why?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(bending the arm)
M|				How does this work?

N|	Olaf's dismembered arm slaps Kristoff across the face.

M|				OLAF
M|				Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus
M|				here.
M|				(to Anna)
M|				Yeah, why?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to
M|				bring back summer.

M|				OLAF
M|				(shocked)
M|				Summer?
M|				(sinking into wistfulness)
M|				Oh, I don't know why but I've
M|				always loved the idea of summer,
M|				and sun, and all things hot.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Really? I'm guessing you don't have
M|				much experience with heat.

M|				OLAF
M|				Nope. But sometimes I like to close
M|				my eyes and imagine what it'd be
M|				like when summer does come.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:


S|	OLAF'S FANTASY WORLD -- PERFECT SUMMER DAY

N|	Olaf walks through a grassy meadow with the sun shining
N|	behind him. He SINGS.

M|				"In Summer"

N|	-Olaf sails in a boat.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)

N|	-Olaf floats in the water. All his pieces begin to separate.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				AND FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO SOLID
M|				WATER / WHEN IT GETS WARM.

N|	-Olaf tumbles on a sandy beach with sand-snowmen.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE / WHAT MY

M|				IMAGINE HOW MUCH COOLER I'LL BE IN

N|	-Olaf and another snowman drink hot chocolate in a hot tub.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				THE HOT AND THE COLD ARE BOTH SO
M|				INTENSE / PUT `EM TOGETHER, IT JUST
M|				MAKES SENSE!

N|	-Olaf tap dances with a gaggle of seagulls.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				RATDADAT DAD DADA DOO . . .

N|	-Olaf bounds down a grassy hill.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				WINTER'S A GOOD TIME TO STAY IN AND

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				HAPPY SNOWMAN!

N|	-Olaf runs with a checkered blanket that he spreads out. He
N|	relaxes and stares at the blue sky.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				WHEN LIFE GETS ROUGH I LIKE TO HOLD
M|				ON TO MY DREAM / OF RELAXING IN THE
M|				SUMMER SUN JUST LETTING OFF STEAM!

N|	Sven, Anna, Kristoff and Olaf have a picnic.

M|				SUMMER!

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				I'm gonna tell him.

M|				ANNA
M|				Don't you dare.

M|				OLAF
M|				IN SUMMER!

N|	Olaf sings the final note. We swing around him and return to:

N|	REALITY. He then straightens up and smiles.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				So, come on! Elsa's this way. Let's
M|				go bring back summer!

N|	Olaf grabs Anna's hand and pulls her along up the mountain.

M|				ANNA
M|				(laughing)
M|				I'm coming!

N|	Sven hops along, happily following them. Kristoff watches all
N|	of them like they're nuts.

S|	EXT. ARENDELLE, VILLAGE -- DAY

N|	A layer of solid ice coats everything. People huddle around
N|	weak fires. Anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and
N|	guests. We pass two CITIZENS fighting over a woodpile.

M|				CITIZEN ONE
M|				No. No. You've got the bark facing
M|				down. The bark needs to be face-up.

M|				CITIZEN TWO
M|				Bark down is drier.

M|				CITIZEN ONE
M|				Bark up.

M|				CITIZEN TWO
M|				Bark down.

M|				CITIZEN ONE
M|				Bark up.

N|	Like a light in the dark, Hans moves through the crowd.

M|				HANS
M|				Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?

M|				GERDA
M|				Arendelle is indebted to you, Your
M|				Highness.

M|				HANS
M|				The castle is open. There's soup
M|				and hot gl�gg in the Great Hall.

N|	He hands the stack of cloaks to a guard.

M|				HANS (CONT'D)
M|				Here. Pass these out.

N|	Just then the Duke approaches Hans.

M|				DUKE
M|				Prince Hans, are we just expected
M|				to sit here and freeze while you
M|				give away all of Arendelle's
M|				tradable goods?

M|				HANS
M|				(tall and confident)
M|				Princess Anna has given her orders
M|				and--
M|				60
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				DUKE
M|				And that's another thing; has it
M|				dawned on you that your princess
M|				may be conspiring with a wicked
M|				sorceress to destroy us all?

N|	Hans's nice eyes turn to threatening slits.

M|				HANS
M|				Do not question the Princess. She
M|				left me in charge, and I will not
M|				hesitate to protect Arendelle from
M|				treason.

M|				DUKE
M|				(flabbergasted, offended)
M|				Treason?!

N|	Suddenly they hear the alarmed whinny of Anna's horse. It
N|	returns alone, bucking and kicking. Hans grabs its reins.

M|				HANS
M|				Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.

M|				CROWD
M|				(various)
M|				Princess Anna's horse. What
M|				happened to her? Where is she?

N|	Hans steadies the horse, looks up at the mountain. He sees
N|	all the panicked faces of the kingdom looking to him.

M|				HANS
M|				...Princess Anna is in trouble.
M|				(calling out)
M|				I need volunteers to go with me to
M|				find her!

N|	Volunteers, some from Arendelle, some from other lands, rush
N|	up to offer their services.

M|				DUKE
M|				I volunteer two men, my Lord!
M|				(quietly to his thugs)
M|				Be prepared for anything, and
M|				should you encounter the Queen, you
M|				are to put an end to this winter.
M|				Do you understand?

N|	His two thugs sneer.

S|	EXT. THE NORTH MOUNTAIN -- DAY

N|	Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf move through hostile terrain.
N|	Wind-swept icicles face horizontal.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				So how exactly are you planning to
M|				stop this weather?

M|				ANNA
M|				(confident)
M|				Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				That's your plan? My ice business
M|				is riding on you talking to your
M|				sister.

M|				ANNA
M|				Yup.

N|	Kristoff, so stunned by her casual plan, doesn't look where
N|	he's going and ends up with an ice-spike to the nose. He
N|	stops short, GULP, moves carefully around the spike.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				So you're not at all afraid of her?

M|				ANNA
M|				Why would I be?

M|				OLAF
M|				(oblivious)
M|				Yeah. I bet Elsa's the nicest,
M|				gentlest, warmest person ever.

N|	Olaf backs right into an icicle. It runs through his torso.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				Oh, look at that. I've been
M|				impaled.

N|	He laughs it off.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:


S|	EXT. STEEP MOUNTAIN FACE -- DAY

N|	Anna and Kristoff hit what looks like a dead end. The face of
N|	the mountain goes straight up.

M|				ANNA
M|				What now?
M|				62
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Kristoff looks around, sighs. Digs in his rucksack.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				...It's too steep. I've only got
M|				one rope, and you don't know how to
M|				climb mountains.

M|				ANNA (O.S.)
M|				Says who?

N|	Sven nudges Kristoff, who looks up to see Anna trying to
N|	climb the cliff's flat face.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(finding her ridiculous)
M|				What are you doing?

M|				ANNA
M|				(straining)
M|				...I'm going to see my sister.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				You're going to kill yourself.

N|	Kristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand-holds.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				I wouldn't put my foot there.

M|				ANNA (O.S.)
M|				You're distracting me.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Or there. How do you know Elsa even
M|				wants to see you?

M|				ANNA (O.S.)
M|				I'm just blocking you out cause I
M|				gotta concentrate here.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				You know, most people who disappear
M|				into the mountains want to be
M|				alone.

M|				ANNA (O.S.)
M|				Nobody wants to be alone. Except
M|				maybe you--

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				I'm not alone.... I have friends,
M|				remember?

N|	Anna kicks a foot above her head to catch a foot hold.
M|				63
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA
M|				You mean the love experts?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Yes, the love experts!

N|	Anna realizes she's stuck.

M|				ANNA
M|				...Please tell me I'm almost there.

N|	REVEAL: she's only about six feet up. Her muscles shake.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				...Does the air seem a bit thin to
M|				you up here?

N|	Kristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Hang on.

N|	He pulls the rope from his bag. Just then Olaf steps out from
N|	behind a rock and waves to Kristoff.

M|				OLAF
M|				Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is
M|				going to solve the problem, but I
M|				found a staircase that leads
M|				exactly where you want it to go.

M|				ANNA
M|				Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!

N|	Anna drops off the cliff. Kristoff catches her.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Thanks! That was like a crazy trust
M|				exercise.

N|	She hops down, brushes off her dress, and bounds off.
N|	Kristoff watches after her, digging her fearless pluck.


S|	EXT. BASE OF THE ICE PALACE -- DAY

N|	Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf approach Elsa's elegant ice palace.

M|				ANNA
M|				Whoa.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(in awe)
M|				Now that's ice. I might cry.
M|				64
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA
M|				Go ahead. I won't judge.

N|	Anna climbs the steps with Olaf. Sven tries to follow. His
N|	hooves slip out. He scrambles but can't get traction.
N|	Kristoff runs to his aide.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				All right, take it easy. I gotcha.

N|	Kristoff settles Sven back down the stairs and pats him.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				You stay right here, buddy.

N|	Sven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his
N|	tail. Kristoff climbs the stairs, admiring the ice details.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				...Flawless.

N|	Anna arrives at the door. Hesitates.

M|				OLAF
M|				...Knock....
M|				(she doesn't)
M|				Just knock....
M|				(she doesn't. To Kristoff)
M|				Why isn't she knocking...? Do you
M|				think she knows how to knock?

N|	Anna finally KNOCKS. The sound echoes inside. The ice doors
N|	slide open.

M|				ANNA
M|				Ha. It opened. That's a first.

N|	Anna goes to step in. Kristoff follows. She gets a thought,
N|	stops him.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				You should probably wait out here.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				What?

M|				ANNA
M|				Last time I introduced her to a
M|				guy, she froze everything.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice
M|				is my life.
M|				65
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				OLAF
M|				Bye, Sven.

N|	Olaf starts to head inside. Anna stops him.

M|				ANNA
M|				You too, Olaf.

M|				OLAF
M|				Me?

M|				ANNA
M|				Just give us a minute.

M|				OLAF
M|				Okay.

N|	As Anna walks inside. Olaf starts counting.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				One...two...

N|	Kristoff joins in.

M|				OLAF AND KRISTOFF
M|				Three...four...


S|	INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY

N|	Anna walks into a great foyer. The place is beautiful, but
N|	also eerie.

M|				ANNA
M|				Elsa? It's me...Anna?!

N|	Anna slips. Steadies herself.

M|				ELSA (O.S.)
M|				Anna.

N|	Elsa steps out of the shadows onto a balcony. She sees Anna,
N|	looks to her longingly.

N|	Anna can't help but be struck by Elsa's beauty.

M|				ANNA
M|				Elsa, you look different.... It's a
M|				good different.... And this place
M|				is amazing.
M|				66
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ELSA
M|				(cautious, polite)
M|				Thank you, I never knew what I was
M|				capable of.

N|	Anna starts to climb the stairs.

M|				ANNA
M|				...I'm so sorry about what
M|				happened. If I'd known--

N|	Elsa backs up, away from Anna.

M|				ELSA
M|				(on guard)
M|				No, it's okay. You don't have to
M|				apologize.... But you should
M|				probably go, please.

M|				ANNA
M|				But I just got here.

M|				ELSA
M|				...You belong in Arendelle.

M|				ANNA
M|				So do you.

N|	Anna takes another step up. Elsa backs up more.

M|				ELSA
M|				No, I belong here. Alone. Where I
M|				can be who I am without hurting
M|				anybody.

M|				ANNA
M|				...Actually, about that--

M|				OLAF (O.S.)
M|				58...59...60.

M|				ELSA
M|				Wait. What is that?

N|	Olaf comes running in the front door. He waves.

M|				OLAF
M|				Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

M|				ELSA
M|				(shocked)
M|				Olaf?

N|	Olaf stops beside Anna, looks up at Elsa, intimidated.
C|						67
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				OLAF
M|				(bashful)
M|				You built me. You remember that?

M|				ELSA
M|				(astonished)
M|				And you're alive?

M|				OLAF
M|				Um...I think so?

N|	Anna kneels down beside Olaf.

M|				ANNA
M|				He's just like the one we built as
M|				kids.... We were so close. We can
M|				be like that again.

N|	Elsa smiles, but then a memory returns to her.

M|				FLASH CUT TO:

N|	FLASHBACK: Young Anna is struck by Elsa's powers.

M|				YOUNG ELSA
M|				Anna!

N|	Young Anna falls unconscious. Young Elsa races to her.

M|				FLASH CUT TO:

N|	THE PRESENT: Elsa's face sinks in pain.

M|				ELSA
M|				No, we can't.

N|	Elsa turns and heads up the second story steps.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				Goodbye, Anna.

M|				ANNA
M|				Elsa, wait--

M|				ELSA
M|				(calling back)
M|				I'm just trying to protect you.

N|	Elsa continues to flee. Anna pursues.

M|				ANNA
M|				You don't have to protect me. I'm
M|				not afraid. Please don't shut me
M|				out again.
M|				68
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Anna SINGS.

M|				"First Time in Forever, Reprise"

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				PLEASE DON'T SLAM THE DOOR.
M|				YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP YOUR
M|				DISTANCE ANYMORE.

M|				`CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
M|				FOREVER,
M|				I FINALLY UNDERSTAND.
M|				FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
M|				WE CAN FIX THIS HAND IN HAND.
M|				WE CAN HEAD DOWN THIS MOUNTAIN
M|				TOGETHER.
M|				YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR.
M|				`CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
M|				FOREVER,
M|				I WILL BE RIGHT HERE.

N|	They arrive on the top floor, Elsa's main living space. Elsa
N|	turns back to Anna, grateful, but determined.

M|				ELSA
M|				Anna,
M|				PLEASE GO BACK HOME.
M|				YOUR LIFE AWAITS.
M|				GO ENJOY THE SUN
M|				AND OPEN UP THE GATES.

M|				ANNA
M|				Yeah, but--

M|				ELSA
M|				I know!
M|				YOU MEAN WELL,
M|				BUT LEAVE ME BE.
M|				YES, I'M ALONE BUT I'M ALONE AND
M|				FREE.

N|	Elsa opens up the balcony doors.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				JUST STAY AWAY AND YOU'LL BE SAFE
M|				FROM ME.

M|				ANNA
M|				ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT.

M|				ELSA
M|				WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT?
M|				69
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA
M|				I GET THE FEELING YOU DON'T KNOW?

M|				ELSA
M|				WHAT DO I NOT KNOW?

M|				ANNA
M|				ARENDELLE'S IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP
M|				SNOW.

M|				ELSA
M|				What?

N|	Elsa looks past Anna's shoulder out white-peaked mountains.

M|				ANNA
M|				You kind of set off an eternal
M|				winter...everywhere.

M|				ELSA
M|				Everywhere?

M|				ANNA
M|				It's okay, you can just unfreeze
M|				it.

M|				ELSA
M|				No, I can't. I don't know how.

M|				ANNA
M|				Sure you can. I know you can.

N|	Snow starts to swirl around the room.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				CUZ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

M|				ELSA
M|				(panicking)
M|				I'M SUCH A FOOL!
M|				I CAN'T BE FREE!

M|				ANNA
M|				YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

M|				ELSA
M|				NO ESCAPE
M|				FROM THE STORM INSIDE OF ME!

N|	The snow picks up. Anna tries to fight through it.

M|				ANNA
M|				WE CAN WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER.
M|				70
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ELSA
M|				I CAN'T CONTROL THE CURSE!

M|				ANNA
M|				WE'LL REVERSE THE STORM YOU'VE
M|				MADE.

M|				ELSA
M|				ANNA, PLEASE, YOU'LL ONLY MAKE IT
M|				WORSE!

M|				ANNA
M|				DON'T PANIC.

M|				ELSA
M|				THERE'S SO MUCH FEAR!

M|				ANNA
M|				WE'LL MAKE THE SUN SHINE BRIGHT.

M|				ELSA
M|				YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE!

M|				ANNA
M|				WE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER...

N|	But as Anna sings, we lose sight of her in the thickening
N|	blizzard taking over the room.

M|				ELSA
M|				NO!

M|				ANNA (O.S.)
M|				WE CAN CHANGE THIS WINTER WEATHER,
M|				AND EVERYTHING WILL BE...

N|	Anna's voice disappears in the storm as Elsa cries out.

M|				ELSA
M|				I CAN'T!

N|	Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and
N|	then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake.

N|	Anna is STRUCK right in the heart. She grasps her chest in
N|	pain and stumbles back. She falls to her knees.

N|	Elsa gasps when she sees Anna. Just then, Olaf and Kristoff
N|	rush into the room to Anna's side.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Anna. Are you okay?

D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA
M|				I'm okay.... I'm fine.

N|	Anna gets to her feet, determined to hide the pain.

M|				ELSA
M|				(scared)
M|				Who's this? Wait, it doesn't
M|				matter. You have to go.

M|				ANNA
M|				No, I know we can figure this out
M|				together--

M|				ELSA
M|				(desperate)
M|				How? What power do you have to stop
M|				this winter? To stop me?

N|	Anna doesn't have the answer. Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows
N|	creeping down the walls. Puts a protective arm around Anna.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Anna, I think we should go.

M|				ANNA
M|				(close to tears)
M|				No. I'm not leaving without you,
M|				Elsa.

M|				ELSA
M|				(heartbroken but decisive)
M|				Yes, you are.

N|	Elsa waves her arms and builds a giant, menacing snowman.
N|	We'll call him MARSHMALLOW.

M|				SLAM CUT TO:


S|	EXT. ICE PALACE -- DAY

N|	Marshmallow holds Anna and Kristoff by the scruff of their
N|	necks in one hand and Olaf in the other.

M|				ANNA
M|				Stop. Put us down!

M|				OLAF
M|				(to Marshmallow)
M|				You are a lot stronger than I think
M|				you realize.

N|	Marshmallow tosses Kristoff and Anna down the steps.
M|				72
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				MARSHMALLOW
M|				(like a bouncer)
M|				Go away!

N|	Anna and Kistoff slide past Sven, who's got his tongue stuck
N|	to the ice railing.

M|				OLAF (O.S.)
M|				Heads up!

N|	Olaf's head smashes into a snowbank nearby.

M|				ANNA
M|				Olaf!

M|				OLAF
M|				Watch out for my butt!

N|	Anna and Kristoff duck as the rest of Olaf slams into the
N|	snowbank.

N|	Marshmallow turns to go back into the castle.

N|	Incensed, Anna tries to march back up the stairs.

M|				ANNA
M|				It is not nice to throw people!

N|	Kristoff grabs her, pulls her back.

M|				KRISTOFF                                   ANNA
N|	All right feisty pants. Calm             Let me at him. I want to get
N|	down. Woaw. Just let the snow            him. I.... Okay. I'm Calm.
N|	man be.

N|	Anna backs down...for a moment. Then she grabs a snowball and
N|	throws it at Marshmallow.

N|	The tiny little ball hits Marshmallow's back, not making even
N|	the slightest dent. But it's enough to infuriate him. He
N|	ROARS. Spikes shoot out of his joints.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!

M|				OLAF
M|				...I'll distract him. You guys go.

N|	Kristoff pushes Anna along. Sven runs off in the opposite
N|	direction. Olaf's belly and butt fall and follow Sven.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				No, no, not you guys.
M|				73
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Marshmallow goes charging after Anna and Kristoff as Olaf's
N|	head falls and lands face down in snow.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				(muffled)
M|				This just got a whole lot harder.

N|	Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope. They
N|	tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard
N|	right behind them.

N|	They're off again...through a maze of conifers that sag under
N|	the weight of the snow, Marshmallow hot on their trail.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				This way!

N|	Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of
N|	the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				(impressed)
M|				Ho-ho-ho!

M|				ANNA
M|				I got him!

N|	Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost
N|	run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Whoa, stop!

M|				ANNA
M|				It's a hundred foot drop.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				It's two hundred.

N|	Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight.

M|				ANNA
M|				Ow.

N|	He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the
N|	snow with a pick axe.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				What's that for?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				I'm digging a snow anchor.
M|				74
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA
M|				(not trusting)
M|				Okay. What if we fall?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				There's twenty feet of fresh powder
M|				down there; it'll be like landing
M|				on a pillow.... Hopefully.

N|	They hear an angry ROAR coming closer.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Okay, Anna. On three.

N|	Anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight.

M|				ANNA
M|				Okay. You tell me when...

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				One...

M|				ANNA
M|				...I'm ready to go....

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Two...

M|				ANNA
M|				(pumped up)
M|				...I was BORN ready! Yes!

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Calm down.

N|	A huge tree flies through the air toward them.

M|				ANNA (O.S.)
M|				TREE!

N|	Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They
N|	hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches
N|	their fall.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Whoa! That happened.

N|	Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. He's a complete
N|	mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places. He huffs
N|	and puffs, struggling to run.

M|				OLAF
M|				Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.
M|				75
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	He stops. Puts his body back together in the right order.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven!
M|				Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost
M|				Marshmallow back there!

N|	Marshmallow steps up behind Olaf. Olaf turns to face him.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				(happily)
M|				Hey. We were just talking about
M|				you. All good things, all good
M|				things.

N|	Marshmallow roars and approaches Kristoff's snow anchor.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				NO!

N|	Olaf jumps onto Marshmallow's leg trying to stop him, but not
N|	making much of a difference.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				This is not making much of a
M|				difference!

N|	Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				WHOA!

N|	Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff.

M|				ANNA
M|				Olaf!

M|				OLAF
M|				Hang in there, guys!

N|	Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Anna's rope up.

M|				ANNA
M|				Wait, what?

N|	Kristoff's head hits the cliff.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Aargghh!

N|	Kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll.

M|				ANNA
M|				Kristoff!
M|				76
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Marshmallow pulls them up. He roars and breathes snow all
N|	over them.

M|				MARSHMALLOW
M|				Don't come back!

M|				ANNA
M|				(grossed out by his snow
M|				breath)
M|				Ugh. We won't.

N|	Anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope. Kristoff comes to
N|	just as they fall. They both SCREAM!

S|	SLAM!

N|	REVEAL: Anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her
N|	shoulders in the soft thick snow. She laughs.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				Hey, you were right. Just like a
M|				pillow.

N|	She looks up to see Olaf's upper half hanging onto Kristoff's
N|	boots, which are sticking out of the snow.

M|				OLAF
M|				(shaking the boots)
M|				I can't feel my legs! I can't feel
M|				my legs!

N|	Suddenly, Kristoff's head pops up. He spits out snow.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Those are my legs.

N|	Olaf's bottom goes running by.

M|				OLAF
M|				(to Kristoff)
M|				Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my
M|				butt.

N|	Kristoff grabs Olaf's head and puts it on his body.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				Oh, that feels better.

N|	Sven walks up and sniffs Olaf's nose.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				Hey, Sven!
M|				77
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Olaf turns to Anna and Kristoff just as Sven goes to bite off
N|	his nose -- and misses.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				He found us.
M|				(to Sven, funny voice)
M|				Who's my cute little reindeer?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Don't talk to him like that.

N|	Kristoff goes over to help Anna, who is stuck in the snow.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Here.

N|	He lifts her out easily.

M|				ANNA
M|				(impressed)
M|				Whoa!

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				You okay?

M|				ANNA
M|				Thank you.

N|	They meet eyes. Wait. Is that chemistry?

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				...Um.... How's your head?

N|	She touches the spot where he banged his head.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(in pain)
M|				Ah! Ooh!

N|	He catches himself. Waves off the pain with a giggle.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				I mean, It's fine. Ah...I'm good.
M|				Ha. I've got a thick skull.

M|				OLAF
M|				I don't have a skull.... Or bones.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				...So....

N|	The awkwardness is killing him.
M|				78
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				(shy)
M|				Now what?

M|				ANNA
M|				(shy)
M|				Now what?
M|				(then...panicking)
M|				Now what?! Oh! What am I gonna do?
M|				She threw me out. I can't go back
M|				to Arendelle with the weather like
M|				this. And then there's your ice
M|				business--

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice
M|				business...
M|				(noticing something)
M|				Worry about your hair?!

N|	She thinks he means it looks bad. She smooths it down.

M|				ANNA
M|				What? I just fell off a cliff. You
M|				should see your hair.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				No, yours is turning white.

N|	She grabs her braid as a tendril turns white.

M|				ANNA
M|				White? It's what?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				It's because she struck you; isn't
M|				it?

M|				ANNA
M|				Does it look bad?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(thinking)
M|				...No.

N|	Olaf's head pops up. He's holding his head up off his body to
N|	join the conversation.

M|				OLAF
M|				You hesitated.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				No, I didn't. Anna, you need help.
M|				Now, come on.
M|				79
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	He heads towards the sunset. Sven and Olaf follow.

M|				OLAF
M|				Okay! Where are we going?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				To see my friends.

M|				ANNA
M|				(catching up)
M|				The love experts?

M|				OLAF
M|				Love experts?!

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Yes. And don't worry; they'll be
M|				able to fix this.

M|				ANNA
M|				How do you know?

N|	He looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls
N|	heal her as a child.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				...Because I've seen them do it
M|				before.

N|	As they round the bend, the sun sets and Olaf turns to Sven.

M|				OLAF
M|				I like to consider myself a love
M|				expert.

M|				CUT TO:


S|	INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY

N|	Elsa paces, distraught. She talks to herself.

M|				ELSA
M|				(mantra-style)
M|				Get it together. Control it. Don't
M|				feel. Don't feel. Don't FEEL!

N|	She hears ice cracking. Stops. Looks around. She's left a
N|	sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor. They grow
N|	up the wall, taking over the castle.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:
M|				80
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



S|	EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

N|	The Northern Lights are bright. Olaf stares at them in awe as
N|	he rides on Sven's back.

M|				OLAF
M|				Look, Sven. The sky's awake.

N|	Behind Olaf and Sven, Anna walks with Kristoff. She shivers.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Are you cold?

M|				ANNA
M|				...A little.

N|	He reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides
N|	against it. He looks around as if he doesn't know what to do,
N|	then gets a thought.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Wait. Come here.

N|	He takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock-
N|	lined pass.

N|	Steam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path.
N|	He holds her hands over one of them.

M|				ANNA
M|				Oooh.... That's nice.

N|	They continue on the path, walking from vent to vent.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(taking a deep breath)
M|				So, about my friends...well, I say
M|				friends, they're more like
M|				family.... Anyway, when I was a
M|				kid, it was just me and
M|				Sven...until they took me in.

M|				ANNA
M|				(moved)
M|				They did?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(nervous ramble)
M|				Yeah. I don't want to scare you,
M|				they can be a little bit
M|				inappropriate...and loud...very
M|				loud...they're also stubborn at
M|				times, and a little overbearing.
M|				And heavy. Really, really heavy.
M|				(MORE)
M|				81
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				But they're fine.. You'll get it.
M|				They mean well.

N|	Anna touches Kristoff's arm, reassuringly.

M|				ANNA
M|				Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

N|	Kristoff smiles, appreciating her sincerity.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Okay then....

N|	Mustering the courage, Kristoff steps forward and with a wave
N|	of the arms announces--

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Meet my family.

N|	REVEAL: he's surrounded by rocks.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				(to the rocks)
M|				Hey, guys!

N|	As Kristoff and Sven move through the rocks, waving and
N|	greeting, Olaf and Anna stand frozen, dumbfounded.

M|				ANNA
M|				(to herself)
M|				...They're rocks.

M|				OLAF
M|				(realizing)
M|				He's crazy.
M|				(covertly, to Anna)
M|				I'll distract them while you run.
M|				(Loud and slow to a rock)
M|				Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to
M|				meet you!
M|				(quietly to Anna)
M|				Anna, because I love you, I insist
M|				you run.
M|				(to the rock)
M|				I understand you're love experts!
M|				(to Anna)
M|				Why aren't you running?

N|	Anna snaps out of her shock and starts backing away.

M|				ANNA
M|				Okay. Um...I'm gonna go--

N|	Just then the rocks around her start rolling.
M|				82
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				(panicking)
M|				Kristoff!

N|	Olaf lights up and chases the rocks, who surround Kristoff
N|	and unfold as trolls.

M|				BULDA
M|				KRISTOFF'S HOME!

M|				TROLLS (VARIOUS)
M|				Kristoff! Kristoff's home! It's
M|				been too long! Kristoff's home!

N|	Olaf jumps around all excitedly.

M|				OLAF
M|				(excitedly)
M|				Kristoff's home.

N|	He then stops, confused, and looks to one of the trolls.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				Wait? Kristoff?

N|	Anna watches, shocked and confused.

N|	The trolls all want Kristoff's attention. One troll yanks him
N|	down with a boulder's strength.

M|				TROLL ONE
M|				Oh, lemme look at you!

N|	Another troll tries to pull off his clothes.

M|				TROLL TWO
M|				Oh, take off your clothes,
M|				Kristoff; I wash them.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(holding up his pants)
M|				Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes
M|				on, thank you.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Great to see you all. Where's
M|				grandpa?

M|				MUSHROOM KID TROLL
M|				He's napping. But look, I grew a
M|				mushroom.

M|				TROLL SCOUT KID
M|				And I earned my fire crystal.
M|				83
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				KIDNEY STONE TROLL
M|				I passed a kidney stone.

M|				PICK ME UP TROLL
M|				Pick me up.

N|	The kid troll jumps up on Kristoff's arm. Kristoff sinks
N|	under the weight of him.

N|	Anna still stares, confused, then realizes...

M|				ANNA
M|				Trolls? They're trolls.

N|	Silence. All troll eyes turn to Anna. Blink. Blink.

M|				BULDA
M|				...He's brought a girl!

M|				TROLLS (TOGETHER)
M|				He's brought a girl!

N|	Suddenly Anna is surrounded by trolls. They body-surf/roll
N|	Anna over to Kristoff. She falls into his arms.

M|				ANNA
M|				What's going on?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				I've learned to just roll with it.

N|	Bulda climbs on top of her husband, Cliff, to get a good look
N|	at Anna. She studies her like she's a piece of cattle.

M|				BULDA
M|				Let me see. Bright eyes. Working
M|				nose. Strong teeth. Yes, yes, yes.
M|				She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

M|				ANNA
M|				Wait. Oh. Um. No.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				You've got the wrong idea. That's
M|				not why I brought her here.

M|				ANNA
M|				Right. We're not. I'm not--

N|	Anna laughs, uncomfortable, not knowing what to say.
M|				84
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				BULDA
M|				(to Anna)
M|				What's the issue, dear? Why are you
M|				holding back from such a man?

N|	Bulda SINGS.

M|				"Fixer-Upper"

M|				TROLLS (VARIOUS)
M|				IS IT THE CLUMPY WAY HE WALKS?
M|				OR THE GRUMPY WAY HE TALKS?
M|				OR THE PEAR-SHAPED, SQUARE-SHAPED
M|				WEIRDNESS OF HIS FEET?
M|				AND THOUGH WE KNOW HE WASHES WELL
M|				HE ALWAYS ENDS UP SORTA SMELLY.
M|				BUT YOU'LL NEVER MEET A FELLA WHO'S
M|				AS SENSITIVE AND SWEET.

M|				TROLLS (CHORUS) (CONT'D)
M|				SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
M|				SO HE'S GOT A FEW FLAWS-
M|				HIS PECULIAR BRAIN, DEAR.
M|				HIS THING FOR THE REINDEER
M|				THAT OUTSIDE A FEW OF NATURE'S
M|				LAWS.
M|				SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
M|				BUT THIS WE'RE CERTAIN OF-
M|				YOU CAN FIX THIS FIXER UPPER UP
M|				WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Can we just stop talking about
M|				this?! We've got a real, actual
M|				problem here.

M|				BULDA
M|				I'll say--
M|				(To Anna)
M|				IS IT THE WAY THAT HE RUNS SCARED?

M|				TROLLS (VARIOUS)
M|				OR THAT HE'S SOCIALLY IMPAIRED?

M|				KID TROLL
M|				OR THAT HE ONLY LIKES TO TINKLE IN
M|				THE WOODS?

M|				TROLLS (VARIOUS)
M|				ARE YOU HOLDING BACK YOUR FONDNESS
M|				DUE TO HIS UNMANLY BLONDENESS?
M|				OR THE WAY HE COVERS UP THAT HE'S
M|				THE HONEST GOODS?
M|				85
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				TROLLS (CHORUS) (CONT'D)
M|				HE'S JUST A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER-
M|				HE'S GOT A COUPLE A' BUGS.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				No, I don't.

M|				TROLLS
M|				HIS ISOLATION
M|				IS CONFIRMATION
M|				OF HIS DESPERATION FOR HEALING
M|				HUGS.
M|				SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
M|				BUT WE KNOW WHAT TO DO.
M|				THE WAY TO FIX UP THIS FIXER UPPER
M|				IS TO FIX HIM UP WITH YOU.

N|	The girl trolls sweep Anna away. The boys take Kristoff.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(to the male trolls)
M|				Enough! She's engaged to someone
M|				else. Okay?!

N|	TROLLS beat. Blink. Blink. The boy trolls turn, huddle...

M|				TROLLS (VARIOUS)
M|				SO SHE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
M|				THAT'S A MINOR THING.
M|				THIS QUOTE "ENGAGEMENT"
M|				IS A FLEX ARRANGEMENT.

M|				KID TROLL
M|				AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T SEE NO
M|				RING.

M|				TROLLS (VARIOUS)
M|				SO SHE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
M|				HER BRAIN'S A BIT BETWIXT.
M|				GET THE FIANCE
M|				OUT OF THE WAY
M|				AND THE WHOLE THING WILL BE FIXED!

M|				GIRL TROLLS
M|				WE AREN'T SAYING YOU CAN CHANGE HIM

M|				TROLLS (VARIOUS)
M|				'CAUSE PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CHANGE.
M|				WE'RE ONLY SAYING THAT LOVE'S A

M|				TROLLS (VARIOUS) (CONT'D)
M|				BUT THROW A LITTLE LOVE THEIR WAY
M|				(THROW A LITTLE LOVE THEIR WAY)
M|				AND YOU'LL BRING OUT THEIR BEST!
M|				TRUE LOVE BRINGS OUT THE BEST!

N|	Kristoff looks over at Anna. She actually looks shockingly
N|	beautiful dressed in moss, lit by shimmering crystals.

M|				ALL TROLLS
M|				EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
M|				THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
M|				FATHER, SISTER, BROTHER
M|				WE NEED EACH OTHER
M|				TO RAISE US UP AND ROUND US OUT

N|	By this time Kristoff and Anna are being ushered into a pit
N|	by the sheer force of numbers.

M|				TROLLS
M|				EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,
M|				BUT WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE-
M|				THE ONLY FIXER UPPER FIXER THAT CAN
M|				FIX A FIXER UPPER IS
M|				TRUE
M|				TRUE
M|				TRUE
M|				TRUE
M|				LOVE

N|	During this last bit Anna and Kristoff are looking at each
N|	other differently. Hmmm. Maybe those trolls are right?
N|	Sparks! Chemistry!

M|				TROLL PRIEST
M|				Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be
M|				your trollfully wedded--

M|				ANNA
M|				Wait, what?!

M|				TROLL PRIEST
M|				You're getting married.

M|				TROLLS
M|				LOVE!

N|	Just then, Anna collapses. Kristoff catches her. She's
N|	shivering something fierce.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Anna?

N|	He pulls off her cape and hat.
M|				87
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				She's as cold as ice.

N|	Just then Grand Pabbie pushes his way through the crowd.
N|	Trolls clear the way for Pabbie. He stops at the edge of the
N|	pit.

M|				GRAND PABBIE
M|				There's strange magic here!

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Grand Pabbie!

M|				GRAND PABBIE
M|				Bring her to me, Kristoff.

N|	Kristoff helps Anna over. Pabbie looks into her weak eyes.

M|				GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)
M|				Anna, your life is in danger. There
M|				is ice in your heart, put there by
M|				your sister. If not removed, to
M|				solid ice will you freeze, forever.

M|				ANNA
M|				What...? No.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				So remove it, Grand Pabbie.

M|				GRAND PABBIE
M|				I can't. If it was her head, that
M|				would be easy. But only an act of
M|				true love can thaw a frozen heart.

M|				ANNA
M|				An act of true love?

M|				BULDA
M|				(googley, to her hubby)
M|				A true love's kiss, perhaps?

N|	A bunch of trolls give each other kisses.

N|	Anna shivers again, collapsing into Kristoff's arms. More of
N|	her hair turns white.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Anna, we've got to get you back to
M|				Hans.

M|				ANNA
M|				(still weak)
M|				...Hans.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Help us out, Sven.

N|	Kristoff grabs Sven's antlers. Sven pulls them out.

N|	Kristoff helps Anna onto Sven and hops up behind her.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Come on, Olaf!

N|	Sven takes off. Olaf grabs Sven's tail, rides with them.

M|				OLAF
M|				I'm coming! Let's go kiss Hans! Who
M|				is this Hans?!

M|				CUT TO:


S|	EXT.    ELSA'S PALACE - DAWN

N|	Hans and the men tread cautiously towards the castle.

M|				HANS
M|				We are here to find Princess Anna.
M|				Be on guard, but no harm is to come
M|				to the Queen. Do you understand?

N|	The Duke's thugs exchange a look. Suddenly, a mass of snow
N|	rises from the ground behind Hans. It's Marshmallow, Elsa's
N|	snow guard.

M|				MARSHMALLOW
M|				Go away!

N|	He slams a fist inches from Hans. Hans deftly dodges out of
N|	the way. All of the guards take up arms against Marshmallow,
N|	who quickly knocks them over.

N|	Marshmallow throws down a guard and his horse, who topple
N|	over Hans. Marshmallow raises his foot to stomp on Hans, but
N|	Hans barrel-rolls himself to safety. He sees his sword,
N|	leaps, and grabs it.

N|	Just then, Elsa peeks out the front doors.

N|	The Duke's two thugs see her.

M|				DUKE'S THUG
M|				The Queen.

N|	The thugs charge up the stairs.

D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



S|	INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY

N|	They guards burst through the ice doors.

N|	Elsa flees to the top floor of her palace. The guards pursue.

N|	They trap her on the top floor, raise their crossbows.

M|				ELSA
M|				(scared)
M|				No. Please.

N|	One of the thugs shoots an arrow right at Elsa. At the last
N|	moment she creates an ice wall. It stops the arrow, inches
N|	from her face.

N|	The thugs reposition to take another shot.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				Stay away!

N|	Elsa shoots ice at the thugs. They duck out of the way and
N|	continue the attack.

M|				THUG
M|				Get her! Get her!

N|	Elsa fights for her life.

N|	BACK OUTSIDE: Hans is nearly crushed by Marshmallow. He rolls
N|	away. Jumps to his feet. And with agile might, he slices
N|	Marshmallow's leg off with his sword. Marshmallow stumbles
N|	back, off balance. And falls off over the cliff, but not
N|	before striking Hans. Hans goes over the edge.

N|	REVEAL: Hans clings to the ice steps. His men help him up and
N|	they rush into the ice palace.


S|	INT. ICE PALACE -- DAY

N|	Elsa is surrounded. It's do or die. In two swift moves, Elsa
N|	traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck.

N|	The other she pushes back with a wall of ice....up against
N|	the balcony doors...which BURST and CRACK.

N|	OUT ONTO THE BALCONY.... The balcony doors shatter. The thug
N|	is pushed to the edge. He's inches away from falling to his
N|	death.

N|	BACK INSIDE: Hans and his men run in. See the destruction and
N|	the thugs near death.

D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				HANS
M|				Queen Elsa! Don't be the monster
M|				they fear you are.

N|	Elsa snaps out of her rage. She sees the men, frightened,
N|	moments from death. She stops. Elsa looks to Hans,
N|	overwhelmed, frightened.

N|	The wall retreats from the thug on the balcony. The ice
N|	spikes lower from the second thug's neck. He takes advantage
N|	and aims his crossbow at Elsa's back.

N|	Seeing it. Hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the
N|	arrow releases. The arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging
N|	directly above Elsa.

N|	The chandelier comes CRASHING DOWN.

N|	Elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast.

N|	All we see is ice smashing like glass, and all we hear is the
N|	sound of it shattering as it rings out.

M|				CUT TO BLACK.


S|	FADE IN ON:

N|	Elsa's face as her eyes flutter open.

N|	She sits up. She's surrounded by stone.


S|	INT. ARENDELLE, DUNGEON -- DAY

N|	Elsa looks to the nearby window. Tries to rush to it. She's
N|	pulled taut by giant shackles that fit like iron gloves.
N|	She's chained to the wall.

N|	Elsa strains to looks out a window...

N|	INSET WINDOW: Arendelle is outside, frozen solid and getting
N|	further buried under the ice and snow that is falling.

M|				ELSA
M|				No....What have I done?

N|	Hans enters. He hangs a torch by the door.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				Why did you bring me here?

M|				HANS
M|				I couldn't just let them kill you.
M|				91
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ELSA
M|				But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get
M|				Anna.

M|				HANS
M|				Anna has not returned....

N|	Elsa looks to the storm with worry.

M|				HANS (CONT'D)
M|				If you would just stop the winter,
M|				bring back summer...please.

N|	Elsa meets his eyes, desperate.

M|				ELSA
M|				Don't you see...I can't.

N|	Hans sees the sincerity in her eyes.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				You have to tell them to let me go.

N|	Hans walks to the door. He takes the torch.

M|				HANS
M|				I will do what I can.

N|	He opens the door and leaves.

N|	Elsa, distraught, hears cracking. She looks down as her
N|	shackles begin to freeze over. The storm outside picks up.

M|				CUT TO:


S|	EXT. THE FJORDS -- DAY

N|	Sven charges down the mountain with Kristoff and Anna on his
N|	back. Olaf slides along beside them, penguin-style.

N|	Anna shivers in Kristoff's arms. She's weakening. Kristoff
N|	takes off his hat and puts it on her head.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Just hang in there.
M|				(to Sven)
M|				Come on, buddy, faster!

N|	They arrive at the walls of Arendelle. Olaf slides past them,
N|	out of control.

M|				OLAF
M|				I'll meet you guys at the castle!
M|				92
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Stay out of sight, Olaf!

M|				OLAF
M|				I will!

N|	He disappears into the village streets.

M|				OLAF (O.S.) (CONT'D)
M|				Hello!

M|				TOWNSWOMAN (O.S.)
M|				Ah! It's alive!

M|				CUT TO:


S|	EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAY

N|	Guards see Kristoff and Anna approaching.

M|				GUARD
M|				It's Princess Anna!

N|	Sven skids to a stop outside the gates. Kristoff slides off,
N|	holding Anna, and carries her to the gate.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				I've got you.

N|	Anna looks up at him, gratefully.

M|				ANNA
M|				...Are you g-gonna be okay?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(touched, reassuring)
M|				Don't worry about me.

N|	Just then the castle gates open. Gerda, Kai, and a handmaid
N|	rush to help Anna.

M|				GERDA
M|				Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick.

M|				KAI
M|				My Lady. You are freezing.

M|				GERDA
M|				You poor girl, you're freezing.
M|				Let's get you inside.
M|				93
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Get her warm and find Prince Hans,
M|				immediately.

M|				KAI
M|				We will. Thank you.

N|	Anna is swept away from Kristoff and into the palace grounds.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Make sure she's safe!

N|	Kristoff is shut out as the castle gates close on him.

N|	Kristoff stands there with Sven for a beat, staring with
N|	worry at the closed gates.

N|	Finally, he sighs, turns and walks off. Sven reluctantly
N|	follows.

M|				CUT TO:


S|	INT. LIBRARY -- DAY

N|	Hans stands with the dignitaries and guards.

M|				HANS
M|				I'm going back out to look for
M|				Princess Anna.

M|				FRENCH DIGNITARY
M|				You cannot risk going out there
M|				again.

M|				HANS
M|				If anything happens to her--

M|				SPANISH DIGNITARY
M|				If anything happens to the
M|				Princess, you are all Arendelle has
M|				left.

N|	Hans hesitates, realizing how much this kingdom has come to
N|	depend on him. Is he really all they have left?

N|	Just then the door opens and Gerda and Kai bring in Anna.

M|				KAI
M|				He's in here. Prince Hans.

M|				HANS
M|				Anna.
M|				94
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Hans rushes to Anna. She falls into his arms.

M|				HANS (CONT'D)
M|				You're so cold.

M|				ANNA
M|				(weak, but desperate)
M|				Hans, you have to kiss me.

M|				HANS
M|				What?

M|				ANNA
M|				Now. Here we go.

N|	She tries to kiss him, but is too weak to pull herself up in
N|	his arms.

M|				GERDA
M|				We'll give you two some privacy.

N|	Everyone shuffles out, leaving Hans and Anna alone.

M|				HANS
M|				What happened out there?

M|				ANNA
M|				Elsa struck me with her powers.

M|				HANS
M|				You said she'd never hurt you.

M|				ANNA
M|				I was wrong.

N|	Anna crumbles, weak.

M|				HANS
M|				Anna.

N|	Hans carries her to a couch, sets her down.

M|				ANNA
M|				(shivering more)
M|				She froze my heart and only an act
M|				of true love can save me.

M|				HANS
M|				(understanding)
M|				A true love's kiss.

N|	He takes her chin in his hand and gives her a tender smile.
N|	He leans in slowly...gently...
M|				95
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Then he stops.

M|				HANS (CONT'D)
M|				Oh, Anna. If only there was someone
M|				out there who loved you.

M|				ANNA
M|				What?

N|	Hans gets up, leaving her there.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				...You said you did.

N|	He goes to the window and shuts the curtains.

M|				HANS
M|				As thirteenth in line in my own
M|				kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I
M|				knew I'd have to marry into the
M|				throne somewhere--

M|				ANNA
M|				What are you talking about?

M|				HANS
M|				(putting out the candles)
M|				As heir, Elsa was preferable, of
M|				course. But no one was getting
M|				anywhere with her. But you-

M|				ANNA
M|				Hans?

M|				HANS
M|				You were so desperate for love you
M|				were willing to marry me, just like
M|				that.

N|	Hans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table
N|	and goes to the fireplace.

M|				HANS (CONT'D)
M|				I figured, after we married, I'd
M|				have to stage a little accident for
M|				Elsa.

N|	Hans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire.
N|	Anna tries to stop him. She falls to the floor, weak.

M|				ANNA
M|				Hans. No, stop.
M|				96
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				HANS
M|				But then she doomed herself, and
M|				you were dumb enough to go after
M|				her.

M|				ANNA
M|				Please.

M|				HANS
M|				(chuckles)
M|				All that's left now is to kill Elsa
M|				and bring back summer.

N|	Hans approaches Anna.

M|				ANNA
M|				...You're no match for Elsa.

N|	He bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time
N|	not so gently.

M|				HANS
M|				No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on
M|				the other hand, am the hero who is
M|				going to save Arendelle from
M|				destruction.

N|	She wrenches her face out of his hands.

M|				ANNA
M|				(anger)
M|				You won't get away with this.

N|	Hans rises and crosses to the door.

M|				HANS
M|				Oh, I already have.

N|	Hans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door. Anna
N|	struggles to the door, yanks on the locked handle.

M|				ANNA
M|				(hoarse and weak)
M|				Please, somebody help.

N|	The rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the
N|	floor.

M|				CUT TO:

S|	INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER -- NIGHT

N|	The Duke looks out the window at the growing snowstorm. He
N|	rubs his arms and shivers.

M|				DUKE
M|				It's getting colder by the minute.
M|				If we don't do something soon,
M|				we'll all freeze to death.

N|	Hans comes in, putting on his most distraught face.

M|				SPANISH DIGNITARY
M|				Prince Hans.

M|				HANS
M|				Princess Anna is...dead.

M|				VARIOUS DIGNITARIES
M|				What...? No.... Mon dieu.

N|	Hans stumbles, weak with grief. The men help him to a chair.

M|				DUKE
M|				What happened to her?

M|				HANS
M|				She was killed by Queen Elsa.

M|				DUKE
M|				Her own sister.

M|				HANS
M|				(really putting it on)
M|				At least we got to say our marriage
M|				vows...before she died in my arms.

N|	He bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief.

M|				DUKE
M|				There can be no doubt now; Queen
M|				Elsa is a monster and we are all in
M|				grave danger.

M|				SPANISH DIGNITARY
M|				Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to
M|				you.

N|	Hans nods; he knows what he's being asked to do, and he'll do
N|	it with the perfect amount of authority and gravitas.
M|				98
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				HANS
M|				With a heavy heart, I charge Queen
M|				Elsa of Arendelle with treason and
M|				sentence her to death.


S|	INT. ELSA'S DUNGEON -- DAY

N|	The cell ices over. Elsa looks out at the storm that is
N|	devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching.

M|				GUARD (O.S.)
M|				She's dangerous. Move quickly and
M|				with resolve.

N|	Elsa pulls at her shackles. They crack. Just as the door
N|	busts open, the weight of the ice crumbles the walls. The men
N|	duck out of the way.

N|	Hans pushes his way into the room...sees...

N|	The back wall is blown open. Broken shackles rest on the
N|	floor. Elsa is gone.


M|				CUT TO:


S|	EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE -- DAY

N|	Kristoff heads into the mountains. Sven lags behind, not
N|	wanting to follow. He looks back at the kingdom, then shakes
N|	his head. Enough.

N|	He runs past Kristoff. Stops and turns to face him. He snorts
N|	and grunts.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				What is it, buddy?

N|	Sven nudges Kristoff with his antlers.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Hey, watch it. What's wrong with
M|				you?

N|	Sven snorts with more conviction, moos, brays.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				(avoiding)
M|				...I don't understand you when you
M|				talk like that.
M|				99
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Kristoff tries to walk on ahead, but Sven uses his antlers to
N|	lift Kristoff off the ground.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Ah! Stop it! Put me down!

N|	Sven drops him hard then "yells" at him once more.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				No, Sven! We're not going back!

N|	Sven shakes his head, angrily.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				She's with her true love.

N|	Sven makes an "of-course-she-isn't" face. Kristoff gets it;
N|	he's made his point.

N|	Just then the wind picks up. Kristoff looks back at the
N|	kingdom. Sees a violent winter storm swirling over the
N|	castle. Sharp ice claws its way up the castle, encasing it.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Anna.

N|	Without hesitating, he dashes back down the mountain. Sven
N|	runs after him, catches up. Kristoff grabs Sven's harness and
N|	jumps onto his back.

M|				CUT TO:


S|	INT. LIBRARY -- NIGHT

N|	Anna shivers by the door. She looks up to see ice overtaking
N|	the ceiling.

N|	The door handle suddenly jiggles. Stops. Jiggles again.

M|				ANNA
M|				(barely a whisper)
M|				Help.

N|	CLICK. The door swings open. We see a carrot in the lock and
N|	hear a giggle of victory. Olaf takes the carrot, puts it back
N|	on his face. Then he sees Anna lying there.

M|				OLAF
M|				Anna. Oh no.

N|	He runs to the fireplace. Throws in some fresh wood,
N|	including one of his own arms, which he quickly rescues,
N|	before striking a match and relighting the fire.

M|				ANNA
M|				Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.

M|				OLAF
M|				Whoa! So this is heat....
M|				(considering)
M|				I love it.

N|	He reaches a twig finger toward the flames. It catches on
N|	fire.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				Ooh! But don't touch it!

N|	He shakes the flame out, as he rushes over to help Anna to
N|	the fire.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				So, where's Hans? What happened to
M|				your kiss?

M|				ANNA
M|				I was wrong about him. It wasn't
M|				true love.

M|				OLAF
M|				(confused innocence)
M|				Huh. But we ran all the way here?

M|				ANNA
M|				Please Olaf, you can't stay here;
M|				you'll melt.

M|				OLAF
M|				I am not leaving here until we find
M|				some other act of true love to save
M|				you.

N|	He sits down behind her, stubbornly. Leans his back against
N|	hers and thinks.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				...Do you happen to have any ideas?

M|				ANNA
M|				I don't even know what love is.

M|				OLAF
M|				(confident)
M|				That's okay, I do....

N|	Olaf hops back up and puts a soothing hand on her shoulder.
M|				101
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				Love is...putting someone else's
M|				needs before yours, like, you know,
M|				how Kristoff brought you back here
M|				to Hans and left you forever.

M|				ANNA
M|				...Kristoff loves me?

M|				OLAF
M|				Wow, you really don't know anything
M|				about love, do you?

N|	His face starts to melt.

M|				ANNA
M|				Olaf, you're melting.

M|				OLAF
M|				(sweet and reassuring)
M|				Some people are worth melting for.

N|	But then...his face REALLY melts. He panics, pushes the snow
N|	back in place.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				Just maybe not right this second.

N|	Suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				Don't worry, I've got it!

N|	Olaf flitters to the window. He pulls one panel of it shut
N|	but struggles with the second panel.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				(determined)
M|				We're going to get through--
M|				(distracted)
M|				Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting
M|				something.

N|	He breaks an icicle off the window, uses it as a telescope
N|	and sees...

N|	Kristoff and Sven running back down the mountain.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				It's Kristoff and Sven! They're
M|				coming back this way.

M|				ANNA
M|				...They-they are?
M|				102
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				OLAF
M|				Wow, he's really moving fast.
M|				Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I
M|				guess Kristoff doesn't love you
M|				enough to leave you behind.

N|	Anna tries to get to her feet.

M|				ANNA
M|				Help me up, Olaf. Please.

N|	He hurries over, tumbling over the couch, knocking over the
N|	chess set and water jugs.

M|				OLAF
M|				No, no, no, no, no. You need to
M|				stay by the fire and keep warm.

M|				ANNA
M|				I need to get to Kristoff.

M|				OLAF
M|				(clueless)
M|				Why...?
M|				(realizing)
M|				Oh, oh, oh, I know why.

N|	He hops around in an excited display of hope.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				There's your act of true love,
M|				right there, riding across the
M|				fjords like a valiant, pungent
M|				reindeer king! Come on!

N|	The walls crack under the ice pressure.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				Look out!

N|	They rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses.


S|	INT. CASTLE HALLWAY -- DAY

N|	Anna and Olaf struggle down the hall. Ice spikes grow and
N|	block their path.

M|				OLAF
M|				We're trapped.

N|	Anna looks around desperately for a way out.

D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



S|	EXT. FJORD -- DAY

N|	Elsa runs, but is nearly blinded by the snow and wind.


S|	EXT. CASTLE -- DAY

N|	Anna and Olaf bust open a window. The storm is so strong it
N|	sweeps the window panes away.

M|				OLAF
M|				Slide, Anna.

N|	It's a long, snowy way down. But what choice do they have?
N|	They slide down the iced-covered building.

N|	Anna arrives at the bottom, weak but uninjured. Olaf gathers
N|	snow along the way. He arrives at the bottom as a giant
N|	snowball.

M|				OLAF (CONT'D)
M|				We made it!

N|	He shakes off the extra snow as Anna struggles to her feet.


S|	EXT. FJORD -- DAY

N|	Kristoff and Sven bound off the mountain and sprint across
N|	the frozen fjord waters and right into the heart of the
N|	storm. Its white-out wind pushes them back. But they fight
N|	through.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Come on, buddy, faster.



M|				CUT TO:

N|	Anna and Olaf reach the shore of the fjords.

M|				ANNA
M|				Kristoff!

N|	The wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart. He goes swirling
N|	off into the storm.

M|				OLAF
M|				Keep going, Anna!

N|	Anna struggles on.
M|				104
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ANNA
M|				Kristoff!

M|				PAN TO:

N|	Kristoff rides Sven past cracking, frozen ships. Sven
N|	struggles over the uneven surface.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Come on! Come on!

N|	Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes   over them.
N|	They give it all they've got as debris falls all   around them
N|	and the mast shatters. They make it past just as   the entire
N|	ship slams down and cracks the thick ice beneath   their feet.

N|	The ice opens up. Sven bravely jumps over a gap. But it's too
N|	wide. He bucks Kristoff to safety, but lands in the freezing
N|	water and disappears below.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Sven? Sven!

N|	At first there's nothing but the wind and the tumbling icy
N|	water. But suddenly, Sven surfaces and claws his way to a
N|	floating ice chunk. He calls out, signalling for Kristoff to
N|	go on.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				Good boy.

M|				CUT TO:

N|	Anna moves blindly across the fjord. Anna's hands frost over
N|	an icy blue. She stumbles on, determined. But she's running
N|	out of time.

N|	She clutches her chest. The color in her eyes fades, the
N|	inevitable is coming.

M|				CUT TO:

N|	Kristoff, lost in the white-out, doesn't know which way to
N|	turn. But then he hears a faint--

M|				ANNA (O.S.)
M|				Kristoff.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Anna...? Anna!

M|				WHITE OUT TO:

D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Elsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is
N|	consuming her. A dark shadow approaches. It's Hans.

M|				HANS
M|				Elsa. You can't run from this!

N|	Elsa backs away from him.

M|				ELSA
M|				...Just take care of my sister.

M|				HANS
M|				Your sister? She returned from the
M|				mountain weak and cold. She said
M|				you froze her heart.

M|				ELSA
M|				What? No.

M|				HANS
M|				I tried to save her, but it was too
M|				late. Her skin was ice. Her hair
M|				turned white...

N|	Elsa's face sinks as she realizes what she has done.

M|				HANS (CONT'D)
M|				Your sister is dead... because of
M|				you.

N|	Elsa drops to her knees, emotionally broken. And with that,
N|	the swirling storm suddenly stops. The snow freezes mid-air,
N|	hangs suspended, trapped in grief.

N|	Citizens and dignitaries rush to the wall's edge and look out
N|	to see...

N|	Anna, barely able to move but now able to see across the
N|	fjords to...

M|				ANNA
M|				(a whisper)
M|				Kristoff.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Anna.

N|	Anna pushes on towards Kristoff. He runs top speed towards
N|	her. There's still a lot of fjord to cross, but Kristoff is
N|	giving it all he's got. He's going to make it.

N|	But then, Anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from
N|	its scabbard. She turns and sees Hans, behind Elsa, as he
N|	raises his sword over his head.

N|	Anna looks back at Kristoff as he runs for her. She gives him
N|	a longing look, but then turns away from him and then...

N|	Using all of her remaining strength, as Hans brings his sword
N|	down, Anna throws herself in front of Elsa.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				No!

N|	In that instant, Anna freezes to solid ice. The sword hits
N|	her instead of Elsa. The sword shatters completely. The force
N|	of it sends Hans flying back and knocks him out.

M|				ELSA
M|				Anna!

N|	Elsa rushes to Anna and touches her sister's frozen face.

M|				ELSA (CONT'D)
M|				Oh, Anna...no...no, please no.

N|	Olaf walks up and sees Anna, frozen.

M|				OLAF
M|				(confused, sad)
M|				Anna?

N|	Elsa hugs Anna and cries.

N|	Kristoff watches in shocked despair. Sven steps up to his
N|	side.

N|	Citizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads.

N|	All of Arendelle is joined in somber silence.

N|	But then, Anna warms. She begins to thaw.

N|	Olaf looks up and gasps. Kristoff and Sven notice, light up.

N|	Anna bends her arm and embraces Elsa.

M|				ELSA
M|				Wha-? Anna?

N|	Anna opens her eyes. She smiles at Elsa, relieved.

M|				ANNA
M|				Oh, Elsa.

N|	They embrace.
M|				107
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



M|				ELSA
M|				...You sacrificed yourself for me?

M|				ANNA
M|				(weak)
M|				...I love you.

N|	Olaf realizes what's happened. He's so excited about it, he
N|	lifts his head right off his body and exclaims--

M|				OLAF
M|				An act of true love will thaw a
M|				frozen heart.

M|				ELSA
M|				(processing)
M|				Love...will thaw...
M|				(realizing)
M|				Love.... Of course.

N|	Elsa looks at Anna with confidence.

M|				ANNA
M|				Elsa?

M|				ELSA
M|				Love.

N|	Elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. The
N|	ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air.

N|	Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws.

N|	The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves.

N|	The villagers come out to see the warmth returning.

N|	In one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant
N|	snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm
N|	summer day.

M|				ANNA
M|				I knew you could do it.

M|				OLAF
M|				(melting, good-naturedly)
M|				Hands down, this is the best day of
M|				my life...and quite possibly the
M|				last.

M|				ELSA
M|				Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.
M|				108
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Elsa waves her hand and surrounds Olaf with a swirl of cold
N|	air. He refreezes. Above his head she leaves a little,
N|	perpetually-snowing storm cloud. Olaf loves it.

M|				OLAF
M|				Hey, my own personal flurry.

N|	Kristoff sees Hans trying to get to his feet. He marches
N|	toward him, prepared for a fight. But Anna puts up a hand and
N|	stops him.

M|				ANNA
M|				Uh. Uh. Uh.

N|	She'll handle this. She goes over to Hans.

M|				HANS
M|				(confused)
M|				Anna? But she froze your heart.

M|				ANNA
M|				The only frozen heart around here
M|				is yours.

N|	She turns away from him, proud of her words. But not yet
N|	satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face.

M|				HANS
M|				Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

N|	He falls overboard.

N|	Elsa comes over to Anna and hugs her. Over her shoulder,
N|	Kristoff meets Anna's eyes. She smiles brighter, happy.

M|				DISSOLVE TO:


S|	EXT. ARENDELLE -- DAY

N|	It's a beautiful summer day. The mighty ships have been
N|	repaired and are sailing away.

N|	On one of the ships, HANS is thrown into a brig.

M|				FRENCH DIGNITARY
M|				(to Kai)
M|				I will return this scoundrel to his
M|				country. We shall see what his
M|				twelve big brothers think of his
M|				behavior.

M|				KAI
M|				Arendelle thanks you, my Lord.
M|				109
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Down on the dock, Arendelle guards lead the Duke and his two
N|	thugs to their ship.

M|				DUKE
M|				This is unacceptable. I am
M|				innocent. I'm a victim of fear.
M|				I've been traumatized.
M|				(bad acting)
M|				Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a
M|				doctor I could...No? And I demand
M|				to see the Queen!

N|	Kai steps down from the gangplank to the dock.

M|				KAI
M|				I have a message from the Queen.
M|				(reading a scroll)
M|				Arendelle will henceforth and
M|				forever no longer do business of
M|				any sort with Weaseltown.

M|				DUKE
M|				Weselton. It's Weselton!

N|	The guards usher him and his thugs onto their ship.


S|	EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE -- DAY

N|	Anna runs through the crowd, pulling a blindfolded Kristoff
N|	along behind her. She's so excited she can't stand it.

M|				ANNA
M|				Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!

N|	She runs him right into a pole.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Pole.

M|				ANNA
M|				Oops. Sorry.


S|	EXT. ARENDELLE DOCKS -- DAY

N|	Anna skips to the perfect spot and stops.

M|				ANNA
M|				(stopping)
M|				Okay. Okay. Here we are.
M|				110
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	She takes off the blindfold. Kristoff opens his eyes. Before
N|	him sits the most beautiful, suped-up sled. Sven poses in
N|	front of it -- Vanna White-style.

M|				ANNA (CONT'D)
M|				I owe you a sled.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				(blown away)
M|				Are you serious?

M|				ANNA
M|				Yes. And it's the latest model.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				No. I can't accept this...

M|				ANNA
M|				You have to. No returns. No
M|				exchanges. Queen's orders. She's
M|				named you the official Arendelle
M|				Ice Master and Deliverer.

N|	Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like he's
N|	king of the bucks.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				What? That's not a thing.

N|	But he can't help but admire her enthusiasm.

M|				ANNA
M|				Sure it is. And it even has a cup
M|				holder.... Do you like it?

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Like it?

N|	He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				I love it.... I could kiss you!

N|	He drops her, suddenly embarrassed.

M|				KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
M|				...I could. I mean I'd like to.
M|				I'd... may I? We me....I mean, may
M|				we? Wait, what?

N|	She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.

M|				ANNA
M|				We may.
M|				111
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	He smiles and goes for it. It's a true love's kiss, alright.

N|	We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer.

N|	With his snow cloud safely overhead, he's free to smell the
N|	flowers, which he does. Then sneezes his carrot nose off.

N|	Sven catches it between his teeth. Olaf gasps as Sven sucks
N|	the whole carrot into his mouth. It's gone.

N|	Olaf's face sinks in sadness. But not to fear, Sven spits the
N|	carrot back out and jams it into Olaf's face where it
N|	belongs. It's completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf
N|	doesn't seem to mind. He hugs Sven happily.

M|				CUT TO:


S|	EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAY

N|	The gates to the castle are wide open. In the courtyard,
N|	stands Elsa.

M|				ELSA
M|				Are you ready?

N|	Villagers cheer. Elsa stops and creates an ice rink. The
N|	people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about.

N|	Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds
N|	some snow flurries for atmosphere.

N|	Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her.

M|				ANNA
M|				I like the open gates.

M|				ELSA
M|				We are never closing them again.

N|	Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally
N|	made of ice) form on Anna's boots.

M|				ANNA
M|				What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
M|				but you know I don't ska--

N|	Elsa grabs Anna's hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna
N|	slips and slides, but laughs in delight.

N|	Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him.

M|				KRISTOFF
M|				Look out. Reindeer coming through!
M|				112
D|			FROZEN - J. Lee



N|	Olaf skates and helps Elsa coach Anna.

M|				OLAF
M|				That's it. Glide and pivot and
M|				glide and pivot.

N|	We pull away slowly, into the sky. We arrive at a bird's-eye
N|	view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been
N|	repaired with a ice.

N|	All is right in Arendelle.

M|				FINAL FADE OUT.

M|				THE END
