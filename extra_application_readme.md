# Extra application

This extra README file is made for the extra application.

Often in Sci-Fi films a whole new world needs to be put into words. 
This means the scene description needs a lot of lines. This is in many cases more than 
the scene description of any other genre film.  

When the scene descriptions are counted in the program, it is possible to determine if the movie 
is a Sci-Fi movie, only with the count of the scene descriptions.

Of course not all Sci-Fi movies have a generally higher scene description count.

Research question? 

- Do sci fi movies have generally more lines of scene description than romcoms? 

Longer movies generally have more scene description lines. 
To remove this advantage we devide the scene description line ('N') by the scene boundary ('S').
