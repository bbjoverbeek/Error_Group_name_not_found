# Extra application

This extra README file is made for the extra application.

Often in Sci-Fi films a whole new world needs to be put into words. 
This means the scene description needs a lot of lines. This is in many cases more than 
the scene description of any other genre film.  

When the scene descriptions are counted in the program, it is possible to determine if the movie 
is a Sci-Fi movie, only with the count of the scene descriptions.

Of course not all Sci-Fi movies have a generally higher scene description count.

Research question? 

- Do sci fi movies have generally more lines of scene description lines per scene boundary than romcoms? 

Longer movies generally have more scene description lines. 
To remove this advantage we devide the scene description line ('N') by the scene boundary ('S').

To test the research question we have used different script test files. 
	These script files can be found under the map /test_files. 
	The script files' form is a text file: .txt file. 
Some Romcoms do not have scene descriptions. 
The Addams familly script has 2 scene boundaries and 7 scene descriptions. 
While mission impossible has 267 scene boundaries and 1453 scene descriptions.
Starwars script has 2077 scene descriptions. 
Frozen script has 1107 scene descriptions and 74 scene boundaries. The movie script has 14.96 scene description lines per scene. 
This explains sci-fi movies have often more scene description lines than other genres of films.
