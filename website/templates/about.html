            <p>For this project it is our goal to create a prepocessing tool that aligns script and subtitles. The character has to be added to the right subtitle and the timestamp has to be added to the right location in the script. For the script we have to label each line (M, metadata; S, scene boundary; N, scene desription; C, character name; D, dialoge) as well. 
                We chose to make a web-based user interface, using Flask, which will present an output on a webpage. A JSON file can be downloaded from that webpage.
                Lastly, we summarize the differences between the script and subtitles in the form of a percentage.</p>

            <p>If you want to perform unit tests, you would have to make a little change to test.py. We open the film files in every function by using a function from create_subtitles.py. To execute test.py on a film chosen by you, you have to change the filename inside these lines of codes. So:            </p>

            <pre><code class='code-multiline'>full_text = create_subtitles.open_file('shrek_subtitles.srt')</code></pre>
