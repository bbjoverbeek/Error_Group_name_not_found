        <p>Using the script generator requires you to have subtitles and a script. The subtitles should be in a .srt file. The script can either be a .txt file containing a movie script or a URL linking to a movie script on IMSDb. If you do not have these yet you can find the subtitles on <a class="inline_link" href="https://www.opensubtitles.com/en">OpenSubtitles</a>  and the script on <a class="inline_link" href="https://imsdb.com/">IMSDb</a>  or go to our  <a class="inline_link" href="{{ url_for('search') }}">search page</a>.</p>

                The generator may not work on some files. It is for example necessary that the scripts and subtitles use UTF-8 encoding. This will prevent a decode error, that happens occasionally, from occurring.

        <h3 id="The subtitles">The subtitles</h3>
        <p>You can search on our website for subtitles on OpenSubtitles. When you have typed your search query and pressed enter, a list with movies will appear on opensubtitles. Click on the movie you would like the subtitles of. Again a list will appear, but this time with the subtitles that are available for that movie. Click on the download button (the fifth column) of the subtitles you want. A zip file gets downloaded. Unzip the zip file on your computer and open the folder that will appear. The file ending on .srt is the one that must be uploaded to the script generator. </p>
        
        <br>
        <h3 id="The script">The script</h3>
        <p> For the script there are two options </p>
        <ul class="list_documentation">
            <li>When getting your script from IMSDb you have to copy paste the text into a text file, because there is no download button. This text file should be uploaded to the script generator.</li>
            <li>You can also copy the URL of the script from IMSDb and paste that URL into the script generator after clicking “use URL”. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>
        <h2 id="Uploading files">Uploading files</h2>
        <p><b>If you uploaded a URL for the script you only have to follow these steps for the subtitles.</b> </p>
        <p>When you have the files on your computer, you can upload them to the script generator. Upload the subtitles file in the first input field and the script file in the second. The files are uploaded correctly when the name of the file is shown beneath the button displaying <i>”upload your subtitles/script here”</i>. Please make sure that the subtitles and the script are from the same movie, otherwise the program won’t work the way it should. After providing both the subtitles and script, click submit. </p>
        
        <br>
        <h2 id="The results">The results</h2>
        <p>Once the files are submitted and processed, you are taken to another page where the results are displayed. A JSON file is ready to be downloaded as well. </p>
