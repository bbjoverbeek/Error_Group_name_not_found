1
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,045
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:52,499
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.

3
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:54,091
This is madness.

4
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,902
We're doomed.

5
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:10,287
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

6
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:14,795
What's that?

7
00:04:57,154 --> 00:04:59,610
R2-D2, where are you?

8
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,623
At last.
Where have you been?

9
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,844
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

10
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:25,422
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines
or smashed into who knows what.

11
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:28,558
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

12
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,194
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

13
00:05:44,952 --> 00:05:46,945
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

14
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,867
What have you done
with those plans?

15
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,956
We intercepted no transmissions.

16
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,910
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

17
00:05:57,305 --> 00:06:01,591
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

18
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:08,597
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!

19
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:11,597
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

20
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:25,652
There's one.
Set for stun.

21
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:33,040
She'll be all right.

22
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,041
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

23
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:39,126
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

24
00:06:39,257 --> 00:06:41,166
You'll be deactivated for sure.

25
00:06:43,177 --> 00:06:45,843
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

26
00:06:45,943 --> 00:06:47,513
Come out,
before somebody sees you.

27
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:52,092
Secret mission? What plans?

28
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:54,766
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.

29
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:00,399
I'm going to regret this.

30
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:10,862
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life forms.

31
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,277
It must have short-circuited.

32
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:15,700
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

33
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:20,044
Are you sure this thing is safe?

34
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,480
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.

35
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:43,983
The Imperial Senate will not
sit still for this.

36
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:47,363
- You've attacked a diplomatic...
- Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

37
00:07:47,491 --> 00:07:49,365
You weren't on
any mercy mission this time.

38
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:53,574
Several transmissions
were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

39
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,541
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

40
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,660
I don't know what
you're talking about.

41
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:01,748
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

42
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,716
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

43
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:06,751
Take her away!

44
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,548
Holding her is dangerous.
If word gets out...

45
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:16,222
it could generate sympathy
for the rebellion in the senate.

46
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:18,679
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

47
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:21,484
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

48
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:23,483
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

49
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:25,235
Leave that to me.

50
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:28,814
Send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.

51
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,034
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...

52
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:33,572
and no transmissions were made.

53
00:08:33,704 --> 00:08:37,868
An escape pod was jettisoned during the
fighting, but no life forms were aboard.

54
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,954
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

55
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,622
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

56
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,797
There'll be no one
to stop us this time.

57
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,420
Yes, sir.

58
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:05,065
How did we get into this mess?

59
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,519
I really don't know how.

60
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,484
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

61
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,703
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

62
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:26,748
What a desolate place this is.

63
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,052
Where do you think you're going?

64
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,763
Well, I'm not going that way.
It's much too rocky.

65
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,350
This way is much easier.

66
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,851
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

67
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,309
Don't get technical with me.

68
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:48,687
What mission?
What are you talking about?

69
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:53,106
I've just about had enough of you.

70
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:55,148
Go that way.

71
00:09:55,286 --> 00:09:58,203
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

72
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:01,494
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...

73
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:03,749
because you won't get it.

74
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,593
No more adventures.

75
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:20,683
I'm not going that way.

76
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:57,554
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

77
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:00,799
He tricked me
into going this way...

78
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:02,809
but he'll do no better.

79
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:08,183
Wait. What's that?

80
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:11,022
A transport. I'm saved.

81
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:12,861
Over here!

82
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:14,068
Hey!

83
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:15,574
Hey!

84
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,116
Help! Please help!

85
00:14:49,664 --> 00:14:50,664
R2?

86
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:58,412
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

87
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,206
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

88
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:38,161
Look, sir. Droids.

89
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:54,144
We stopped.

90
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,978
Wake up. Wake up!

91
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:04,565
We're doomed.

92
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:14,911
Do you think
they'll melt us down?

93
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:29,754
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

94
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,095
Will this never end?

95
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:14,260
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!

96
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:15,850
Luke!

97
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:24,355
Luke, tell Uncle if he gets
a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.

98
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:26,941
Doesn't look like we have
much choice, but I'll remind him.

99
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,282
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

100
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:42,327
No, not that one.

101
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:47,083
I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

102
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:51,166
Protocol? It's my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs...

103
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:54,589
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

104
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:57,532
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed...

105
00:17:57,632 --> 00:18:01,558
I need a droid who understands the
binary language of moisture vaporators.

106
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:04,939
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

107
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,499
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

108
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,819
- Can you speak Bocce?
- Of course. It's like a second language.

109
00:18:10,948 --> 00:18:13,618
- All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
- Shutting up, sir.

110
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:19,301
Take these two to the garage.
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

111
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:22,333
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

112
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,461
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

113
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:27,545
Now come on.
Get to it.

114
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:29,795
All right. Come on.

115
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:34,712
And the red one.
Come on.

116
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:38,256
Come on, red. Let's go.

117
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,643
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?

118
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:02,076
This R2 unit has
a bad motivator. Look.

119
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,580
Hey, what are you
trying to push on us?

120
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:12,541
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

121
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:14,550
Uncle Owen,
what about that one?

122
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:17,252
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

123
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,393
- Take this away.
- You'll be pleased with that one, sir.

124
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,393
He really is in first-class condition.

125
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,478
I've worked with him before.
Here he comes.

126
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,194
Let's go.

127
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,945
Don't you forget this.

128
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:36,523
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.

129
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,985
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

130
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:51,072
I've got such a bad case of dust
contamination I can barely move.

131
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:53,164
It just isn't fair.

132
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,665
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.

133
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:58,253
Is there anything
I might do to help?

134
00:19:58,381 --> 00:20:01,548
No, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest...

135
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:03,300
or teleport me off this rock.

136
00:20:03,428 --> 00:20:04,970
I don't think so, sir.

137
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:08,679
I'm only a droid and not very
knowledgeable about such things.

138
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,089
Not on this planet, anyway.

139
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:13,595
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

140
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,055
Well, if there's a bright centre
to the universe...

141
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,148
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

142
00:20:18,276 --> 00:20:20,185
I see, sir.

143
00:20:20,904 --> 00:20:23,276
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.

144
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:26,151
Just Luke.

145
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:29,988
And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

146
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:32,742
This is my counterpart, R2-D2.

147
00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:34,333
Hello.

148
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:39,001
A lot of carbon scoring here.
Looks like you've seen a lot of action.

149
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,629
With all we've been through, I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are...

150
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,383
with the rebellion and all.

151
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,420
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?

152
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:49,923
That's how we came to be in your
service, if you take my meaning, sir.

153
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:52,346
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.

154
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:54,350
There's not much to tell.

155
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:58,014
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

156
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:00,640
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

157
00:21:01,402 --> 00:21:03,276
Well, my little friend...

158
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:05,693
you got something jammed
in here real good.

159
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:07,781
Were you on a Starcruiser or...

160
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:10,945
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

161
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,656
What's this?

162
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:15,873
"What is what"?
He asked you a question. What is that?

163
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,915
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

164
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:27,250
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

165
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,265
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

166
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,183
Old data. Pay it no mind.

167
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,350
Who is she?
She's beautiful.

168
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:39,813
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

169
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:42,064
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

170
00:21:42,193 --> 00:21:44,417
A person of some importance,
I believe.

171
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:48,368
- Our captain was...
- Is there any more to this recording?

172
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,985
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.

173
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,871
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

174
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:56,622
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

175
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:02,625
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan
Kenobi, a resident of these parts...

176
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,499
and it's a private message for him.

177
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:06,625
Frankly, I don't know
what he's talking about.

178
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,717
Our last master
was Captain Antilles.

179
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:13,471
But with all we've been through,
this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

180
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,719
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

181
00:22:16,853 --> 00:22:19,474
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you
know what he's talking about?

182
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:22,013
I don't know anyone
named Obi-Wan...

183
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:24,982
but old Ben lives
out beyond the Dune Sea.

184
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,854
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

185
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:29,988
I wonder who she is.

186
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:33,615
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.

187
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:40,033
He says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system.

188
00:22:40,168 --> 00:22:42,955
He suggests that
if you remove the bolt...

189
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:45,792
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

190
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:48,000
Oh, yeah. Well...

191
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:51,585
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.

192
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:52,884
Okay.

193
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,386
There you go.

194
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:02,063
Where'd she go? Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

195
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:04,398
"What message"?

196
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:06,435
The one you've just been playing.

197
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:08,609
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

198
00:23:08,738 --> 00:23:10,446
Luke! Luke!

199
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:13,064
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

200
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:15,988
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

201
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,489
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

202
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:25,039
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

203
00:23:26,214 --> 00:23:28,539
No, I don't think
he likes you at all.

204
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:31,000
No, I don't like you either.

205
00:23:39,811 --> 00:23:43,595
- That R2 unit might have been stolen.
- What makes you think that?

206
00:23:43,731 --> 00:23:46,649
I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

207
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:49,184
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

208
00:23:51,614 --> 00:23:55,114
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

209
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:59,403
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

210
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:01,282
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

211
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:06,410
Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to
Anchorhead and have its memory erased.

212
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,643
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

213
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:12,838
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

214
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:14,000
He won't.

215
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:19,012
I don't think he exists any more. He died
about the same time as your father.

216
00:24:19,142 --> 00:24:22,178
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.

217
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:26,350
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

218
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:30,400
In the morning, I want them on the
south ridge working on those condensers.

219
00:24:31,112 --> 00:24:32,571
Yes, sir.

220
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,409
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

221
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:39,868
In fact, I was also thinking
about our agreement...

222
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:42,154
about me staying on
another season.

223
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:47,417
If these new droids work out, I want
to apply to the academy this year.

224
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:50,261
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

225
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:52,214
Sure. There's more
than enough droids.

226
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:54,334
Harvest is when I need you the most.

227
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:56,461
It's only one season more.

228
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:59,716
This year we'll make enough
on the harvest to hire more hands...

229
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:02,138
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

230
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:05,053
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.

231
00:25:05,188 --> 00:25:08,058
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.

232
00:25:08,191 --> 00:25:10,230
That's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

233
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,815
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.

234
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:14,689
I have to go finish
cleaning those droids.

235
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:18,156
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

236
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,277
It means so much to him.

237
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:23,367
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.

238
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:28,992
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

239
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,501
That's what I'm afraid of.

240
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:23,633
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.

241
00:26:23,766 --> 00:26:25,510
Please don't deactivate me.

242
00:26:25,643 --> 00:26:28,265
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

243
00:26:28,396 --> 00:26:31,563
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.

244
00:26:40,116 --> 00:26:42,441
That R2 unit
has always been a problem.

245
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:45,150
These astrodroids
are getting quite out of hand.

246
00:26:45,288 --> 00:26:47,494
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

247
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:50,079
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.

248
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:54,044
- Blast it.
- Couldn't we go after him?

249
00:26:54,172 --> 00:26:57,332
It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople
around. We'll have to wait till morning.

250
00:26:57,467 --> 00:26:59,424
Luke, I'm shutting
the power down.

251
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:01,461
I'll be there in a few minutes.

252
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,089
Boy, am I gonna get it.

253
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:08,757
- That droid's gonna cause me trouble.
- He excels at that, sir.

254
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:11,396
Come on.

255
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:33,375
Have you seen Luke this morning?

256
00:27:33,503 --> 00:27:36,872
He said he had things to do before
he started today, so he left early.

257
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:40,043
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.

258
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,547
He better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday...

259
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,304
or there'll be hell to pay.

260
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:48,887
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

261
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:51,972
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.

262
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,453
Where do you think you're going?

263
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:19,295
Master Luke is your
rightful owner now.

264
00:28:19,424 --> 00:28:22,378
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

265
00:28:23,595 --> 00:28:25,219
Don't talk to me of your mission.

266
00:28:25,346 --> 00:28:28,466
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here.

267
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,007
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

268
00:28:32,061 --> 00:28:33,971
What's wrong with him now?

269
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:36,892
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

270
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:39,017
Sandpeople. Or worse.

271
00:28:40,445 --> 00:28:42,437
Come on.
Let's go have a look.

272
00:28:42,572 --> 00:28:44,031
Come on.

273
00:28:47,577 --> 00:28:50,150
There are two Banthas down there,
but I don't see any...

274
00:28:50,288 --> 00:28:52,031
Wait a second.

275
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:54,952
They're Sandpeople all right.
I can see one of them now.

276
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:10,922
Hello there.

277
00:30:13,346 --> 00:30:16,596
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

278
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:21,012
Don't worry.
He'll be all right.

279
00:30:27,276 --> 00:30:29,767
Rest easy, son.
You've had a busy day.

280
00:30:30,655 --> 00:30:33,572
You're fortunate
to be all in one piece.

281
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:39,028
Ben? Ben Kenobi?

282
00:30:39,163 --> 00:30:41,120
Boy, am I glad to see you.

283
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:44,250
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be travelled lightly.

284
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:50,956
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

285
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,301
This little droid.

286
00:30:55,388 --> 00:30:56,948
He's searching
for his former master...

287
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:59,132
but I've never seen
such devotion in a droid.

288
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:04,305
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

289
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:07,393
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

290
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:10,187
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

291
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:14,114
Obi-Wan.

292
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:19,024
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

293
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:21,572
A long time.

294
00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:25,703
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

295
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:27,495
He's not dead.

296
00:31:27,628 --> 00:31:28,791
Not yet.

297
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:31,875
- You know him?
- Of course I know him.

298
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:33,336
He's me.

299
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:39,298
I haven't gone
by the name of Obi-Wan...

300
00:31:39,432 --> 00:31:42,053
since, oh, before you were born.

301
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:43,762
Then the droid does belong to you.

302
00:31:43,895 --> 00:31:46,516
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

303
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,858
Very interesting.

304
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:53,818
I think we better get indoors.

305
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:57,200
The Sandpeople are easily startled...

306
00:31:57,325 --> 00:32:00,077
but they'll soon be back...
and in greater numbers.

307
00:32:03,206 --> 00:32:04,285
3PO.

308
00:32:13,758 --> 00:32:16,379
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

309
00:32:17,887 --> 00:32:21,090
Can you stand? We've gotta get out
of here before the Sandpeople return.

310
00:32:21,224 --> 00:32:23,929
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

311
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:28,058
There's no sense in you risking
yourself on my account. I'm done for.

312
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,022
No, you're not.
What kind of talk is that?

313
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,024
Quickly. They're on the move.

314
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:41,699
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

315
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:45,528
That's what your uncle told you. He
didn't hold with your father's ideals.

316
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:48,749
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

317
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:51,791
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.

318
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:55,539
I was once a Jedi knight,
the same as your father.

319
00:32:58,136 --> 00:32:59,844
I wish I'd known him.

320
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:02,676
He was the best
starpilot in the galaxy...

321
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:05,473
and a cunning warrior.

322
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:08,092
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

323
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:12,728
And he was a good friend.

324
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:14,269
Which reminds me...

325
00:33:15,528 --> 00:33:17,485
I have something here for you.

326
00:33:19,532 --> 00:33:22,105
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

327
00:33:22,243 --> 00:33:24,864
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

328
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:27,864
He feared you might
follow old Obi-Wan...

329
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:31,415
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,
like your father did.

330
00:33:31,544 --> 00:33:34,462
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.

331
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:36,131
Go ahead.

332
00:33:38,843 --> 00:33:42,212
- What is it?
- It's your father's lightsabre.

333
00:33:43,097 --> 00:33:45,588
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

334
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:48,512
Not as clumsy or random
as a blaster.

335
00:33:49,562 --> 00:33:51,768
An elegant weapon...

336
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:54,852
for a more civilized age.

337
00:33:56,778 --> 00:33:58,817
For over a thousand generations...

338
00:33:58,946 --> 00:34:03,158
the Jedi knights were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old Republic...

339
00:34:03,284 --> 00:34:05,989
before the dark times...

340
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,780
before the Empire.

341
00:34:10,984 --> 00:34:12,707
How did my father die?

342
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:17,745
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

343
00:34:17,882 --> 00:34:20,373
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

344
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:24,504
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

345
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:28,721
He betrayed and murdered your father.

346
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,762
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

347
00:34:34,065 --> 00:34:37,765
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

348
00:34:37,902 --> 00:34:39,396
The Force?

349
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,188
The Force is
what gives a Jedi his power.

350
00:34:43,908 --> 00:34:47,075
It's an energy field
created by all living things.

351
00:34:47,203 --> 00:34:49,409
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

352
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:51,199
It binds the galaxy together.

353
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:01,472
Let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, little friend...

354
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:04,174
and where you come from.

355
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:07,423
- I saw part of a message...
- I seem to have found it.

356
00:35:07,557 --> 00:35:11,851
<i>General Kenobi, years ago you served</i>
<i>my father in the Clone Wars.</i>

357
00:35:11,978 --> 00:35:15,394
<i>Now he begs you to help him</i>
<i>in his struggle against the Empire.</i>

358
00:35:15,523 --> 00:35:18,607
<i>I regret that I am unable to present</i>
<i>my father's request in person.</i>

359
00:35:18,735 --> 00:35:20,644
<i>But my ship</i>
<i>has fallen under attack...</i>

360
00:35:20,778 --> 00:35:22,937
<i>and my mission</i>
<i>to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>

361
00:35:23,072 --> 00:35:26,322
<i>I have placed information vital</i>
<i>to the survival of the rebellion...</i>

362
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,490
<i>into the memory systems</i>
<i>of this R2 unit.</i>

363
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,411
<i>My father will know</i>
<i>how to retrieve it.</i>

364
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:34,367
<i>You must see this droid</i>
<i>safely delivered to him on Alderaan.</i>

365
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:37,623
<i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>

366
00:35:37,754 --> 00:35:40,790
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

367
00:35:55,813 --> 00:35:59,858
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

368
00:35:59,984 --> 00:36:01,395
Alderaan?

369
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:03,437
I'm not going to Alderaan.

370
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:05,777
I've gotta get home.
I'm in for it as it is.

371
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:08,314
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

372
00:36:08,451 --> 00:36:11,535
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

373
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:19,494
I can't get involved.
I've got work to do.

374
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,171
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.

375
00:36:22,298 --> 00:36:24,920
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

376
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:29,837
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.

377
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:33,804
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

378
00:36:33,935 --> 00:36:36,342
Learn about the Force, Luke.

379
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:44,977
I can take you
as far as Anchorhead.

380
00:36:45,697 --> 00:36:49,030
You can get a transport there
to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

381
00:36:50,326 --> 00:36:53,280
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

382
00:37:00,878 --> 00:37:04,461
Until this battle station is fully
operational, we are vulnerable.

383
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,713
The Rebel Alliance
is too well equipped.

384
00:37:06,843 --> 00:37:08,716
They're more dangerous
than you realize.

385
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:11,715
Dangerous to your starfleet,
Commander...

386
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:13,508
not to this battle station.

387
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:17,224
The rebellion will continue to
gain support in the Imperial Senate...

388
00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:21,018
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

389
00:37:21,816 --> 00:37:25,896
I've just received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

390
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:29,647
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

391
00:37:30,366 --> 00:37:31,742
That's impossible.

392
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:34,247
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

393
00:37:34,347 --> 00:37:38,741
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

394
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,119
Fear will keep
the local systems in line.

395
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:46,588
- Fear of this battle station.
- And what of the rebellion?

396
00:37:46,716 --> 00:37:49,919
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station...

397
00:37:50,053 --> 00:37:51,962
it is possible,
however unlikely...

398
00:37:52,096 --> 00:37:54,172
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

399
00:37:54,974 --> 00:37:58,509
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.

400
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:02,891
Any attack by the rebels against this
station would be a useless gesture...

401
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:04,981
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

402
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:08,692
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

403
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:11,113
I suggest we use it.

404
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,452
Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.

405
00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:18,947
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant...

406
00:38:19,082 --> 00:38:20,873
next to the power of the Force.

407
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,416
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

408
00:38:24,545 --> 00:38:27,167
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

409
00:38:27,298 --> 00:38:30,050
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

410
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:34,221
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortress...

411
00:38:41,104 --> 00:38:43,180
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

412
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:47,902
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.

413
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:49,438
As you wish.

414
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:53,737
This bickering is pointless.

415
00:38:54,951 --> 00:38:58,616
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

416
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:00,786
by the time this station
is operational.

417
00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:04,619
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

418
00:39:12,635 --> 00:39:15,838
It looks like the Sandpeople did this.
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

419
00:39:15,972 --> 00:39:18,593
I've just never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

420
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:22,010
They didn't, but we are
meant to think they did.

421
00:39:22,145 --> 00:39:24,018
These tracks are side-by-side.

422
00:39:24,147 --> 00:39:28,275
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.

423
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:31,236
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

424
00:39:31,362 --> 00:39:35,526
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sandpeople.

425
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:40,109
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

426
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:42,702
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

427
00:39:48,212 --> 00:39:51,266
If they traced the robots here, they may
have learned who they sold them to...

428
00:39:51,366 --> 00:39:53,256
and that would lead
them back... home.

429
00:39:53,384 --> 00:39:54,629
Wait, Luke.

430
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:56,718
It's too dangerous.

431
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,198
Uncle Owen.

432
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,658
Aunt Beru.

433
00:41:16,384 --> 00:41:19,254
Now, Your Highness,
we will discuss the location...

434
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:21,925
of your hidden rebel base.

435
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:07,263
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

436
00:42:08,144 --> 00:42:10,018
You'd have been killed too...

437
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:12,815
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

438
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,608
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

439
00:42:17,403 --> 00:42:19,360
There's nothing for me here now.

440
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:22,443
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

441
00:42:38,216 --> 00:42:40,504
Mos Eisley spaceport.

442
00:42:40,635 --> 00:42:45,380
You will never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy.

443
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:48,306
We must be cautious.

444
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:31,099
How long have you
had these droids?

445
00:43:31,227 --> 00:43:34,347
- Three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.

446
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,307
Let me see your identification.

447
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:39,726
You don't need to see
his identification.

448
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:42,186
We don't need to see
his identification.

449
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:44,813
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

450
00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:46,858
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.

451
00:43:48,077 --> 00:43:50,402
He can go about his business.

452
00:43:50,538 --> 00:43:53,741
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.

453
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:55,073
Move along.

454
00:44:12,769 --> 00:44:15,888
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.

455
00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:18,849
Go on, go on.

456
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:23,438
I can't understand how we got by
those troops. I thought we were dead.

457
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:27,865
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

458
00:44:31,162 --> 00:44:34,198
You really think we're gonna find
a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?

459
00:44:34,332 --> 00:44:37,249
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here.

460
00:44:37,377 --> 00:44:41,161
Only watch your step...
this place can be a little rough.

461
00:44:41,297 --> 00:44:43,420
I'm ready for anything.

462
00:44:46,928 --> 00:44:48,802
Come along, R2.

463
00:45:38,855 --> 00:45:42,306
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

464
00:45:42,442 --> 00:45:45,359
Your droids... they'll have to wait
outside. We don't want them here.

465
00:45:45,486 --> 00:45:47,894
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.

466
00:45:48,031 --> 00:45:49,988
I heartily agree with you, sir.

467
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:01,624
I'll have one of those.

468
00:46:36,371 --> 00:46:39,040
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.

469
00:46:41,084 --> 00:46:44,583
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.

470
00:46:44,712 --> 00:46:49,255
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

471
00:46:49,384 --> 00:46:52,171
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead.

472
00:46:52,303 --> 00:46:54,212
This little one's
not worth the effort.

473
00:46:55,431 --> 00:46:57,388
Come, let me get you something.

474
00:47:24,252 --> 00:47:26,209
I'm all right.

475
00:47:27,547 --> 00:47:31,591
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

476
00:47:36,556 --> 00:47:38,548
I don't like the look of this.

477
00:47:53,406 --> 00:47:56,941
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

478
00:47:57,076 --> 00:48:00,243
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

479
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:02,660
Yes, indeed,
if it's a fast ship.

480
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:06,539
Fast ship? You've never heard of
the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>

481
00:48:06,669 --> 00:48:08,247
Should I have?

482
00:48:08,379 --> 00:48:11,499
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

483
00:48:13,551 --> 00:48:15,793
I've outrun imperial starships.

484
00:48:15,928 --> 00:48:17,886
Not the local bulk cruisers,
mind you.

485
00:48:18,014 --> 00:48:20,137
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

486
00:48:21,976 --> 00:48:23,969
She's fast enough for you,
old man.

487
00:48:25,063 --> 00:48:27,933
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers...

488
00:48:28,066 --> 00:48:30,853
myself, the boy, two droids...

489
00:48:32,028 --> 00:48:33,902
and no questions asked.

490
00:48:35,198 --> 00:48:37,025
Is it some kind of local trouble?

491
00:48:37,158 --> 00:48:42,283
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.

492
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,494
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

493
00:48:46,626 --> 00:48:48,535
And it's gonna cost you
something extra.

494
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,088
10,000, all in advance.

495
00:48:53,883 --> 00:48:55,128
10,000?

496
00:48:56,469 --> 00:48:59,007
We could almost
buy our own ship for that.

497
00:48:59,138 --> 00:49:01,345
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

498
00:49:01,474 --> 00:49:03,514
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot.

499
00:49:03,643 --> 00:49:06,015
We don't have
to sit here and listen...

500
00:49:06,145 --> 00:49:08,980
We can pay you 2,000 now...

501
00:49:09,107 --> 00:49:12,357
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

502
00:49:13,152 --> 00:49:14,267
Seventeen?

503
00:49:18,032 --> 00:49:20,274
Okay, you guys
got yourselves a ship.

504
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,865
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.

505
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:24,110
Ninety-four.

506
00:49:25,748 --> 00:49:29,200
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.

507
00:49:30,753 --> 00:49:32,829
All right. We'll check it out.

508
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:48,183
17,000. Those guys
must really be desperate.

509
00:49:48,312 --> 00:49:51,728
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

510
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:54,859
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.

511
00:49:54,986 --> 00:49:56,978
I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

512
00:49:58,114 --> 00:50:00,570
Going somewhere, Solo?

513
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,736
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

514
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,993
Tell Jabba that
I've got his money.

515
00:50:06,122 --> 00:50:07,996
It's too late.

516
00:50:08,124 --> 00:50:10,496
You should have paid him
when you had the chance.

517
00:50:10,626 --> 00:50:14,042
Jabba's put a price on your head
so large...

518
00:50:14,172 --> 00:50:17,089
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you.

519
00:50:17,216 --> 00:50:19,174
I'm lucky I found you first.

520
00:50:19,302 --> 00:50:21,460
Yeah, but this time
I've got the money.

521
00:50:21,596 --> 00:50:25,131
If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.

522
00:50:25,266 --> 00:50:28,552
I don't have it with me.
Tell Jabba...

523
00:50:28,686 --> 00:50:31,142
Jabba's through with you.

524
00:50:31,272 --> 00:50:33,763
He has no time for smugglers...

525
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,540
who drop their shipments at
the first sign of an imperial cruiser.

526
00:50:36,652 --> 00:50:40,353
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

527
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:44,570
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

528
00:50:45,379 --> 00:50:46,861
Over my dead body.

529
00:50:46,996 --> 00:50:48,111
That's the idea.

530
00:50:48,247 --> 00:50:52,197
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

531
00:50:52,335 --> 00:50:53,615
I'll bet you have.

532
00:51:07,684 --> 00:51:09,807
Sorry about the mess.

533
00:51:18,695 --> 00:51:21,696
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

534
00:51:21,823 --> 00:51:25,239
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

535
00:51:25,368 --> 00:51:28,903
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.

536
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:31,197
What course shall we set?

537
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:34,702
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

538
00:51:34,836 --> 00:51:36,414
What do you mean?

539
00:51:36,546 --> 00:51:39,464
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

540
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:42,047
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.

541
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:45,254
Lock the door, R2.

542
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,348
Check this side of the street.

543
00:51:53,563 --> 00:51:56,101
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.

544
00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:05,693
I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.

545
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:09,909
I don't know what this trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

546
00:52:10,747 --> 00:52:12,241
Watch your language.

547
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:16,825
All right. Give it to me.
I'll take it.

548
00:52:17,712 --> 00:52:21,247
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.

549
00:52:21,383 --> 00:52:23,126
It'll be enough.

550
00:52:41,778 --> 00:52:44,814
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!

551
00:52:46,157 --> 00:52:48,115
Right here, Jabba.

552
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:50,863
I've been waitin' for you.

553
00:52:50,996 --> 00:52:52,905
Have you now.

554
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:56,914
You didn't think I was
gonna run, did you?

555
00:52:57,627 --> 00:53:02,040
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

556
00:53:02,174 --> 00:53:04,213
Why haven't you paid me...

557
00:53:04,342 --> 00:53:07,711
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

558
00:53:07,846 --> 00:53:12,093
Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me,
come yourself. Don't send these twerps.

559
00:53:12,225 --> 00:53:15,725
Han, I can't make exceptions.

560
00:53:15,854 --> 00:53:18,689
What if everyone
who smuggled for me...

561
00:53:18,815 --> 00:53:21,353
dropped their cargo
at the first sign...

562
00:53:21,484 --> 00:53:24,106
of an imperial starship?

563
00:53:24,237 --> 00:53:26,111
It's not good business.

564
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:29,608
Look, Jabba,
even I get boarded sometimes.

565
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:33,318
You think I had a choice?

566
00:53:33,455 --> 00:53:35,198
But I got a nice, easy charter.

567
00:53:35,332 --> 00:53:39,376
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.

568
00:53:39,503 --> 00:53:45,042
Han, my boy, you're the best.

569
00:53:45,175 --> 00:53:47,500
So, for an extra 20%...

570
00:53:47,636 --> 00:53:49,593
Fifteen, Jabba.
Don't push it.

571
00:53:49,721 --> 00:53:51,761
Okay, 15%.

572
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:54,013
But if you fail me again...

573
00:53:54,142 --> 00:53:57,060
I'll put a price on your head so big...

574
00:53:57,187 --> 00:54:01,350
you won't be able to go near
a civilized system.

575
00:54:01,483 --> 00:54:04,235
Jabba, you're a wonderful
human being.

576
00:54:05,737 --> 00:54:06,852
Come on!

577
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:16,487
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.

578
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,104
What a piece of junk.

579
00:54:42,232 --> 00:54:44,723
She'll make.5 past light speed.

580
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:47,611
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

581
00:54:47,737 --> 00:54:50,691
I've made a lot of special
modifications myself.

582
00:54:50,824 --> 00:54:54,691
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board, we'll get outta here.

583
00:54:59,332 --> 00:55:00,791
Hello, sir.

584
00:55:09,926 --> 00:55:11,385
Which way?

585
00:55:13,013 --> 00:55:14,970
All right, men,
load your weapons.

586
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,138
Stop that ship.
Blast them.

587
00:55:29,029 --> 00:55:30,986
Chewie, get us out of here!

588
00:55:32,449 --> 00:55:35,948
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.

589
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:57,850
Looks like an imperial cruiser. Our
passengers are hotter than I thought.

590
00:55:57,974 --> 00:55:59,721
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields...

591
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:02,129
while I make the calculations
for the jump to light speed.

592
00:56:12,489 --> 00:56:15,359
Stay sharp. There's two more comin'.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

593
00:56:15,492 --> 00:56:17,626
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought this thing was fast.

594
00:56:17,726 --> 00:56:19,789
Watch your mouth, or you're
gonna find yourself floating home.

595
00:56:19,889 --> 00:56:22,948
We'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

596
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:25,413
Besides, I know a few manoeuvres.
We'll lose 'em.

597
00:56:29,047 --> 00:56:31,040
Here's where the fun begins.

598
00:56:31,174 --> 00:56:32,934
How long before you can
jump to light speed?

599
00:56:33,051 --> 00:56:35,922
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

600
00:56:36,054 --> 00:56:37,596
At the rate they're gaining?

601
00:56:37,722 --> 00:56:40,723
Travelling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy.

602
00:56:40,851 --> 00:56:42,088
Without precise calculations...

603
00:56:42,188 --> 00:56:44,706
we'd fly right through a star
or bounce too close to a supernova...

604
00:56:44,806 --> 00:56:46,971
and that would end your trip
real quick.

605
00:56:47,107 --> 00:56:49,427
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.

606
00:56:49,568 --> 00:56:52,485
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

607
00:57:13,608 --> 00:57:15,897
We've entered
the Alderaan system.

608
00:57:16,945 --> 00:57:20,859
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected
to find you holding Vader's leash.

609
00:57:20,991 --> 00:57:24,609
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

610
00:57:26,288 --> 00:57:28,161
Charming to the last.

611
00:57:28,873 --> 00:57:30,747
You don't know
how hard I found it...

612
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:32,749
signing the order
to terminate your life.

613
00:57:32,877 --> 00:57:35,677
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

614
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,959
Princess Leia,
before your execution...

615
00:57:39,092 --> 00:57:41,250
I would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony...

616
00:57:41,386 --> 00:57:44,387
that will make
this battle station operational.

617
00:57:44,514 --> 00:57:47,301
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

618
00:57:48,018 --> 00:57:50,094
The more you
tighten your grip, Tarkin...

619
00:57:50,228 --> 00:57:52,850
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

620
00:57:52,981 --> 00:57:55,686
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

621
00:57:56,401 --> 00:57:59,817
In a way, you have determined
the choice of the planet...

622
00:57:59,946 --> 00:58:02,069
that'll be destroyed first.

623
00:58:02,198 --> 00:58:06,659
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base...

624
00:58:06,786 --> 00:58:09,574
I have chosen to test
this station's destructive power...

625
00:58:09,706 --> 00:58:11,663
on your home planet of Alderaan.

626
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:15,372
No. Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons.

627
00:58:15,503 --> 00:58:17,792
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

628
00:58:17,922 --> 00:58:20,081
Then name the system.

629
00:58:22,052 --> 00:58:25,385
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

630
00:58:26,306 --> 00:58:28,133
Where is the rebel base?

631
00:58:31,728 --> 00:58:33,306
Dantooine.

632
00:58:34,022 --> 00:58:35,765
They're on Dantooine.

633
00:58:35,899 --> 00:58:39,268
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.

634
00:58:39,402 --> 00:58:42,189
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

635
00:58:42,322 --> 00:58:44,445
- What?
- You're far too trusting.

636
00:58:44,574 --> 00:58:46,982
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

637
00:58:47,118 --> 00:58:51,661
But don't worry. We will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough.

638
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:56,201
Commence primary ignition.

639
00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:21,732
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

640
00:59:23,154 --> 00:59:25,313
I felt a great disturbance
in the Force...

641
00:59:25,448 --> 00:59:28,568
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror...

642
00:59:28,702 --> 00:59:30,611
and were suddenly silenced.

643
00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:33,322
I fear something terrible
has happened.

644
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:37,331
You'd better get on
with your exercises.

645
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:42,293
You can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

646
00:59:42,424 --> 00:59:44,381
I told you I'd outrun them.

647
00:59:48,388 --> 00:59:50,427
Don't everybody
thank me at once.

648
00:59:50,557 --> 00:59:53,926
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

649
01:00:02,527 --> 01:00:04,484
Now be careful, R2.

650
01:00:13,913 --> 01:00:16,451
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

651
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:18,706
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

652
01:00:18,835 --> 01:00:21,160
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

653
01:00:21,296 --> 01:00:25,839
'Cause a droid don't pull people's arms
out of their sockets when they lose.

654
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:28,229
Wookiees are known to do that.

655
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,818
I see your point, sir.

656
01:00:31,951 --> 01:00:35,534
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

657
01:00:54,057 --> 01:00:57,639
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

658
01:00:58,436 --> 01:01:00,725
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.

659
01:01:00,855 --> 01:01:02,729
But it also obeys your commands.

660
01:01:07,987 --> 01:01:12,151
Hokey religions and ancient weapons
are no match for a blaster at your side.

661
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:15,316
You don't believe
in the Force, do you?

662
01:01:15,453 --> 01:01:17,825
Kid, I've flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other.

663
01:01:17,955 --> 01:01:19,829
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

664
01:01:19,957 --> 01:01:22,199
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...

665
01:01:22,335 --> 01:01:25,620
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

666
01:01:25,755 --> 01:01:29,835
There's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.

667
01:01:29,967 --> 01:01:32,803
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

668
01:01:32,929 --> 01:01:35,799
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

669
01:01:37,183 --> 01:01:40,137
This time, let go your conscious self...

670
01:01:42,021 --> 01:01:44,180
and act on instinct.

671
01:01:45,316 --> 01:01:48,732
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?

672
01:01:48,861 --> 01:01:51,233
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.

673
01:02:00,707 --> 01:02:02,995
Stretch out with your feelings.

674
01:02:17,473 --> 01:02:19,596
You see? You can do it.

675
01:02:19,726 --> 01:02:21,350
I call it luck.

676
01:02:21,477 --> 01:02:24,051
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

677
01:02:24,188 --> 01:02:26,430
Good against remotes is one thing.

678
01:02:26,566 --> 01:02:29,520
Good against the living,
that's something else.

679
01:02:30,653 --> 01:02:32,562
We're coming up on Alderaan.

680
01:02:35,992 --> 01:02:38,661
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

681
01:02:38,786 --> 01:02:43,164
That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

682
01:02:48,421 --> 01:02:49,963
Yes?

683
01:02:50,089 --> 01:02:51,998
Our scout ships
have reached Dantooine.

684
01:02:52,133 --> 01:02:54,007
They found the remains
of a rebel base...

685
01:02:54,135 --> 01:02:56,455
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.

686
01:02:56,596 --> 01:02:59,929
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

687
01:03:00,975 --> 01:03:03,513
She lied.
She lied to us.

688
01:03:03,644 --> 01:03:07,310
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

689
01:03:08,691 --> 01:03:10,648
Terminate her immediately.

690
01:03:13,688 --> 01:03:16,309
Stand by, Chewie.
Cut in the sublight engines.

691
01:03:19,068 --> 01:03:20,147
What the...

692
01:03:23,322 --> 01:03:26,987
We've come out in a meteor shower,
some kind of asteroid collision.

693
01:03:27,118 --> 01:03:29,406
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?

694
01:03:29,537 --> 01:03:31,826
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

695
01:03:31,956 --> 01:03:34,162
- Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

696
01:03:34,292 --> 01:03:36,083
It ain't there.
It's been blown away.

697
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,880
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.

698
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:41,205
The entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.

699
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:43,831
It'd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I've...

700
01:03:45,428 --> 01:03:47,866
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.

701
01:03:47,966 --> 01:03:49,320
It's an imperial fighter.

702
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,673
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.

703
01:03:53,811 --> 01:03:55,934
There aren't any bases here.
Where did it come from?

704
01:03:59,233 --> 01:04:01,938
Sure is leaving in a hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.

705
01:04:02,069 --> 01:04:04,149
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

706
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,613
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.

707
01:04:11,495 --> 01:04:14,699
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

708
01:04:14,832 --> 01:04:17,454
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

709
01:04:17,585 --> 01:04:20,420
He ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

710
01:04:22,965 --> 01:04:24,839
He's heading for that small moon.

711
01:04:24,967 --> 01:04:27,458
I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.

712
01:04:29,055 --> 01:04:31,131
That's no moon.

713
01:04:31,265 --> 01:04:34,551
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.

714
01:04:37,939 --> 01:04:40,346
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

715
01:04:40,483 --> 01:04:42,310
Turn the ship around.

716
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:44,649
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse.

717
01:04:44,779 --> 01:04:46,771
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.

718
01:04:51,535 --> 01:04:53,658
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.

719
01:04:55,706 --> 01:04:57,616
Why are we still
moving towards it?

720
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,541
A tractor beam's pulling us in.

721
01:04:59,669 --> 01:05:01,293
There's gotta be
something you can do.

722
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:04,256
There's nothing I can do.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.

723
01:05:04,382 --> 01:05:06,754
They're not gonna get me
without a fight.

724
01:05:10,304 --> 01:05:13,804
You can't win, but there are
alternatives to fighting.

725
01:05:30,491 --> 01:05:32,650
<i>Clear Bay 327.</i>

726
01:05:32,785 --> 01:05:35,074
<i>We are opening</i>
<i>the magnetic field.</i>

727
01:05:49,719 --> 01:05:51,676
To your stations.
Come with me.

728
01:05:56,267 --> 01:05:59,636
<i>Close all outboard shields.</i>
<i>Close all outboard shields.</i>

729
01:06:01,632 --> 01:06:02,326
Yes?

730
01:06:02,426 --> 01:06:05,399
<i>We've captured a freighter entering</i>
<i>the remains of the Alderaan system.</i>

731
01:06:05,526 --> 01:06:09,358
<i>Its markings match those of a ship</i>
<i>that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.</i>

732
01:06:09,488 --> 01:06:13,237
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

733
01:06:13,367 --> 01:06:16,404
She may yet be of some use to us.

734
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,786
<i>Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9.</i>
<i>Release charge.</i>

735
01:06:27,006 --> 01:06:29,046
<i>316, report to control.</i>

736
01:06:32,345 --> 01:06:34,005
There's no one on board, sir.

737
01:06:34,138 --> 01:06:37,124
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after take-off.

738
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:40,470
It must be a decoy. Several
escape pods have been jettisoned.

739
01:06:40,603 --> 01:06:42,512
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.

740
01:06:42,647 --> 01:06:44,447
If there were any,
they must have jettisoned.

741
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:48,058
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

742
01:06:48,194 --> 01:06:49,392
Yes, sir.

743
01:06:49,528 --> 01:06:51,071
I sense something...

744
01:06:51,197 --> 01:06:53,652
a presence I've not felt since...

745
01:06:56,369 --> 01:06:59,702
Get me a scanning crew in here.
I want every part of this ship checked.

746
01:07:08,756 --> 01:07:10,713
There's no one here.

747
01:07:19,642 --> 01:07:21,765
Boy, it's lucky you had
these compartments.

748
01:07:21,894 --> 01:07:24,931
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.

749
01:07:25,064 --> 01:07:26,227
This is ridiculous.

750
01:07:26,357 --> 01:07:28,837
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

751
01:07:28,985 --> 01:07:30,265
Leave that to me.

752
01:07:30,403 --> 01:07:33,439
Damn fool.
I knew you were gonna say that.

753
01:07:33,573 --> 01:07:36,988
Who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?

754
01:07:46,627 --> 01:07:50,245
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

755
01:07:51,924 --> 01:07:53,383
Let's go.

756
01:08:08,107 --> 01:08:10,064
Hey, down there.

757
01:08:11,736 --> 01:08:13,693
Could you give us a hand with this?

758
01:08:22,121 --> 01:08:24,529
TK-421, why aren't you
at your post?

759
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:27,742
TK-421, do you copy?

760
01:08:39,764 --> 01:08:42,681
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

761
01:09:00,534 --> 01:09:02,907
Between his howling
and your blasting everything...

762
01:09:03,037 --> 01:09:05,658
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

763
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:08,411
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight
to sneakin' around.

764
01:09:08,543 --> 01:09:10,286
We've found
the computer outlet, sir.

765
01:09:10,419 --> 01:09:13,420
Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network.

766
01:09:24,684 --> 01:09:28,100
He's found the controls to the power
beam that's holding the ship here.

767
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:31,064
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

768
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:35,402
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.

769
01:09:35,528 --> 01:09:38,529
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

770
01:09:41,325 --> 01:09:44,528
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

771
01:09:44,662 --> 01:09:48,031
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

772
01:09:48,165 --> 01:09:51,997
- I want to go with you.
- Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids.

773
01:09:52,128 --> 01:09:54,085
They must be delivered safely...

774
01:09:54,213 --> 01:09:57,333
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

775
01:09:57,466 --> 01:10:00,752
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

776
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:06,299
The Force will be with you...

777
01:10:06,434 --> 01:10:07,845
always.

778
01:10:17,361 --> 01:10:19,603
You said it, Chewie.

779
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:22,064
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

780
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,778
Ben is a great man.

781
01:10:24,911 --> 01:10:27,751
- Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.

782
01:10:27,914 --> 01:10:30,914
Anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.

783
01:10:31,042 --> 01:10:33,330
Who do you think...

784
01:10:33,461 --> 01:10:36,664
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

785
01:10:36,797 --> 01:10:39,335
He says, "I've found her,"
and keeps repeating, "She's here."

786
01:10:39,467 --> 01:10:42,040
Who? Who has he found?

787
01:10:42,178 --> 01:10:44,883
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?

788
01:10:45,014 --> 01:10:46,674
- Princess?
- Where is she?

789
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:48,681
Princess? What's going on?

790
01:10:54,148 --> 01:10:56,900
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

791
01:11:01,781 --> 01:11:04,354
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

792
01:11:04,492 --> 01:11:07,446
Oh, no.
We've gotta do something.

793
01:11:07,578 --> 01:11:09,986
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.

794
01:11:10,122 --> 01:11:12,033
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

795
01:11:12,133 --> 01:11:14,995
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.

796
01:11:15,127 --> 01:11:18,331
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.

797
01:11:18,464 --> 01:11:20,872
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

798
01:11:21,008 --> 01:11:24,543
You said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

799
01:11:24,679 --> 01:11:27,715
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

800
01:11:27,848 --> 01:11:30,636
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

801
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:39,681
She's rich.

802
01:11:42,363 --> 01:11:43,738
Rich?

803
01:11:44,448 --> 01:11:48,446
Rich, powerful. If you were to
rescue her, the reward would be...

804
01:11:48,578 --> 01:11:51,365
- What?
- Well, more well than you can imagine.

805
01:11:51,497 --> 01:11:53,406
I don't know.
I can imagine quite a bit.

806
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:55,580
- You'll get it.
- I better.

807
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:57,168
You will.

808
01:11:57,295 --> 01:11:59,702
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

809
01:11:59,839 --> 01:12:01,796
- All right.
- What's your plan?

810
01:12:02,842 --> 01:12:05,297
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

811
01:12:06,888 --> 01:12:08,263
Okay.

812
01:12:08,973 --> 01:12:10,847
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.

813
01:12:12,059 --> 01:12:15,226
Okay, Han,
you put those on.

814
01:12:16,355 --> 01:12:18,763
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

815
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,272
Master Luke, sir,
pardon me for asking...

816
01:12:21,402 --> 01:12:24,605
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

817
01:12:24,739 --> 01:12:28,523
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.

818
01:12:28,659 --> 01:12:30,652
That isn't very reassuring.

819
01:12:51,015 --> 01:12:53,055
<i>517 to scanner control.</i>

820
01:12:53,184 --> 01:12:55,223
<i>517 to scanner control.</i>

821
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:01,229
<i>316, report to control.</i>

822
01:13:04,904 --> 01:13:07,110
<i>53 to upper bay door.</i>

823
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,565
<i>53 to upper bay door.</i>

824
01:13:22,004 --> 01:13:24,330
I can't see a thing
in this helmet.

825
01:13:55,788 --> 01:13:58,457
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?

826
01:13:58,583 --> 01:14:00,540
I did say so before.

827
01:14:15,516 --> 01:14:18,719
Where are you
taking this... thing?

828
01:14:18,853 --> 01:14:21,558
Prisoner transfer
from Cell Block 1138.

829
01:14:22,899 --> 01:14:24,808
I wasn't notified.

830
01:14:24,942 --> 01:14:26,899
I'll have to clear it.

831
01:14:33,284 --> 01:14:35,775
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!

832
01:15:00,186 --> 01:15:01,186
Look out.

833
01:15:11,447 --> 01:15:13,903
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

834
01:15:14,033 --> 01:15:16,191
Here it is... 2187.
You go and get her.

835
01:15:16,327 --> 01:15:18,284
I'll hold them here.

836
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:24,781
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.

837
01:15:24,919 --> 01:15:26,082
<i>What happened?</i>

838
01:15:26,212 --> 01:15:28,086
Had a slight weapons malfunction...

839
01:15:28,214 --> 01:15:30,539
but everything's
perfectly all right now.

840
01:15:30,675 --> 01:15:33,841
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.

841
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:36,639
- How are you?
- <i>We're sending a squad up.</i>

842
01:15:37,682 --> 01:15:40,766
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.

843
01:15:40,893 --> 01:15:44,761
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.

844
01:15:44,897 --> 01:15:47,435
<i>Who is this?</i>
<i>What's your operating number?</i>

845
01:15:49,902 --> 01:15:53,354
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!

846
01:16:07,044 --> 01:16:09,535
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

847
01:16:10,923 --> 01:16:12,382
Oh, the uniform.

848
01:16:13,843 --> 01:16:15,919
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

849
01:16:16,053 --> 01:16:18,129
- You're who?
- I'm here to rescue you.

850
01:16:18,264 --> 01:16:20,636
I've got your R2 unit.
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.

851
01:16:20,766 --> 01:16:22,724
- Where is he?
- Come on.

852
01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:27,437
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?

853
01:16:28,232 --> 01:16:31,518
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.

854
01:16:31,652 --> 01:16:35,484
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.

855
01:16:35,615 --> 01:16:37,987
Surely he must be dead by now.

856
01:16:38,117 --> 01:16:40,489
Don't underestimate the Force.

857
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:44,824
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

858
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:48,246
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

859
01:16:49,128 --> 01:16:50,243
Yes.

860
01:16:50,379 --> 01:16:53,879
<i>We have an emergency alert</i>
<i>in Detention Block AA-23.</i>

861
01:16:54,592 --> 01:16:57,083
The princess?
Put all sections on alert.

862
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:00,838
Obi-Wan is here.
The Force is with him.

863
01:17:00,973 --> 01:17:03,808
If you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.

864
01:17:03,935 --> 01:17:07,350
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

865
01:17:16,697 --> 01:17:18,192
Get behind me.

866
01:17:29,669 --> 01:17:32,373
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

867
01:17:35,466 --> 01:17:38,337
- Can't get out that way.
- You cut off our only escape route.

868
01:17:38,469 --> 01:17:41,090
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

869
01:17:43,516 --> 01:17:45,639
- C-3PO. C-3PO.
- <i>Yes, sir?</i>

870
01:17:45,768 --> 01:17:49,219
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off.

871
01:17:51,482 --> 01:17:53,688
What was that?
I didn't copy.

872
01:17:53,818 --> 01:17:57,234
I said all systems have been
alerted to your presence, sir.

873
01:17:57,363 --> 01:17:59,854
The main entrance
seems to be the only way in or out.

874
01:17:59,991 --> 01:18:02,197
All other information on your level
is restricted.

875
01:18:02,326 --> 01:18:04,817
Open up in there.
Open up in there.

876
01:18:05,872 --> 01:18:07,531
Oh, no.

877
01:18:07,665 --> 01:18:09,207
There isn't any other way out.

878
01:18:14,839 --> 01:18:17,045
I can't hold them off forever.
Now what?

879
01:18:17,174 --> 01:18:20,674
Some rescue. When you came in here,
didn't you have a plan for getting out?

880
01:18:20,803 --> 01:18:22,760
He's the brains, sweetheart.

881
01:18:22,889 --> 01:18:24,549
Well, I didn't...

882
01:18:25,766 --> 01:18:29,218
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

883
01:18:31,397 --> 01:18:33,224
Into the garbage chute, fly boy.

884
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:41,740
Get in!

885
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:45,951
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.

886
01:18:46,996 --> 01:18:49,452
Get in there,
and don't worry about it.

887
01:18:51,542 --> 01:18:53,001
Wonderful girl.

888
01:18:55,171 --> 01:18:58,338
Either I'm gonna kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.

889
01:18:59,884 --> 01:19:01,841
Get in there.

890
01:19:14,482 --> 01:19:17,933
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

891
01:19:18,069 --> 01:19:20,441
What an incredible smell
you've discovered.

892
01:19:23,074 --> 01:19:25,280
Let's get out of here.

893
01:19:25,409 --> 01:19:27,698
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.

894
01:19:34,544 --> 01:19:36,869
I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

895
01:19:37,004 --> 01:19:39,246
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

896
01:19:39,382 --> 01:19:41,291
Absolutely, Your Worship.

897
01:19:41,425 --> 01:19:43,845
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here.

898
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:46,715
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us.

899
01:19:46,847 --> 01:19:48,805
It could be worse.

900
01:19:52,728 --> 01:19:53,973
It's worse.

901
01:19:54,105 --> 01:19:57,106
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.

902
01:19:58,109 --> 01:19:59,982
Something just moved
past my leg.

903
01:20:01,737 --> 01:20:03,777
Look. Did you see that?

904
01:20:03,906 --> 01:20:04,906
What?

905
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:27,929
Kid! Luke!

906
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:42,443
Grab hold of this!

907
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:44,895
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

908
01:20:45,031 --> 01:20:47,782
- Where?
- Anywhere!

909
01:21:20,441 --> 01:21:22,019
Help him!

910
01:21:22,151 --> 01:21:24,607
- What happened?
- I don't know.

911
01:21:24,737 --> 01:21:27,026
It just let go of me
and disappeared.

912
01:21:33,079 --> 01:21:35,036
I got a bad feeling about this.

913
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:44,337
- The walls are moving!
- Try and brace it with something.

914
01:21:53,349 --> 01:21:54,843
Help me.

915
01:22:07,613 --> 01:22:09,238
Wait a minute.

916
01:22:11,325 --> 01:22:14,279
3PO! Come in, 3PO!

917
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:17,074
<i>3PO!</i>

918
01:22:17,206 --> 01:22:19,163
<i>Where could he be?</i>

919
01:22:23,462 --> 01:22:25,585
Take over. See to him.

920
01:22:28,092 --> 01:22:29,551
Look, there.

921
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:34,338
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.

922
01:22:34,473 --> 01:22:36,347
If you hurry, you might catch them.

923
01:22:36,475 --> 01:22:37,934
Follow me.

924
01:22:41,689 --> 01:22:43,646
You stand guard.

925
01:22:47,904 --> 01:22:49,184
Come on.

926
01:22:57,538 --> 01:23:00,788
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

927
01:23:00,917 --> 01:23:04,036
If you don't mind, I'd like to
take him down to maintenance.

928
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:05,664
All right.

929
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:20,597
3PO. Come in, 3PO.

930
01:23:20,728 --> 01:23:21,926
3PO.

931
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:24,898
- Get on top.
- I can't.

932
01:23:25,024 --> 01:23:26,851
Where could he be? 3PO.

933
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:30,062
3PO, will you come in.

934
01:23:30,863 --> 01:23:33,070
They aren't here.
Something must have happened.

935
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,357
See if they've been captured. Hurry.

936
01:23:39,705 --> 01:23:42,659
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.

937
01:23:45,002 --> 01:23:47,244
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.

938
01:23:52,635 --> 01:23:56,004
Thank goodness they haven't found them.
Where could they be?

939
01:23:58,558 --> 01:24:00,883
"Use the comlink"? Oh, my.

940
01:24:01,018 --> 01:24:02,892
I forgot.
I turned it off.

941
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:09,184
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?

942
01:24:10,236 --> 01:24:12,774
- We've had some problems.
- <i>Shut up and listen to me.</i>

943
01:24:12,905 --> 01:24:16,654
<i>Shut down all the garbage mashers</i>
<i>on the detention level. Do you copy?</i>

944
01:24:16,784 --> 01:24:19,405
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

945
01:24:20,913 --> 01:24:23,487
<i>Shut down all the garbage mashers</i>
<i>on the detention level!</i>

946
01:24:23,624 --> 01:24:26,376
No, shut them all down.
Hurry! Oh, no.

947
01:24:37,889 --> 01:24:39,347
What?

948
01:24:40,433 --> 01:24:42,306
You did great, 3PO!

949
01:24:42,435 --> 01:24:44,760
Listen to them.
They're dying, R2.

950
01:24:44,896 --> 01:24:46,805
Curse my metal body.
I wasn't fast enough.

951
01:24:46,939 --> 01:24:50,225
It's all my fault.
My poor master.

952
01:24:50,359 --> 01:24:52,392
We're all right.
You did great!

953
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:56,794
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance
hatch on unit number... Where are we?

954
01:24:56,924 --> 01:25:00,258
<i>3263827.</i>

955
01:25:46,015 --> 01:25:49,598
If we can avoid any more female advice,
we oughta be able to get out of here.

956
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:51,554
Let's get moving.

957
01:25:52,772 --> 01:25:54,930
Where you goin'

958
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:56,476
Wait! They'll hear!

959
01:25:58,569 --> 01:26:00,443
Come here, you big coward.

960
01:26:00,571 --> 01:26:02,196
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.

961
01:26:03,115 --> 01:26:05,820
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

962
01:26:05,951 --> 01:26:08,739
but from now on,
you do as I tell you, okay?

963
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,534
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

964
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:15,288
I take orders
from just one person... me.

965
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:17,960
It's a wonder you're still alive.

966
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:21,208
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?

967
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:23,584
No reward is worth this.

968
01:26:33,854 --> 01:26:35,728
Give me regular reports, please.

969
01:26:35,856 --> 01:26:36,936
Right.

970
01:26:39,151 --> 01:26:42,355
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.

971
01:26:47,451 --> 01:26:49,408
You seen that new VT-16?

972
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:51,992
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

973
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:53,996
They say it's quite a thing to see.

974
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:56,034
What was that?

975
01:26:56,168 --> 01:26:59,418
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.

976
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,606
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?

977
01:27:06,735 --> 01:27:07,735
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

978
01:27:07,862 --> 01:27:09,735
- Are you safe?
- <i>For the moment.</i>

979
01:27:09,864 --> 01:27:12,152
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

980
01:27:14,201 --> 01:27:15,779
We're right above you.
Stand by.

981
01:27:15,911 --> 01:27:18,616
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.

982
01:27:18,747 --> 01:27:20,705
Nice. Come on.

983
01:27:24,295 --> 01:27:26,003
It's them.
Blast them.

984
01:27:27,298 --> 01:27:29,041
Get back to the ship!

985
01:27:29,175 --> 01:27:31,146
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.

986
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:34,836
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

987
01:27:59,830 --> 01:28:01,787
I think we took a wrong turn.

988
01:28:06,796 --> 01:28:07,796
There's no lock.

989
01:28:11,759 --> 01:28:14,629
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

990
01:28:14,762 --> 01:28:17,929
- Find the controls to extend the bridge.
- I think I just blasted it.

991
01:28:18,057 --> 01:28:19,800
They're coming through.

992
01:28:41,936 --> 01:28:43,830
Here, hold this.

993
01:29:00,179 --> 01:29:01,218
Here they come.

994
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,895
For luck.

995
01:29:20,075 --> 01:29:24,024
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

996
01:29:38,927 --> 01:29:40,201
Where could they be?

997
01:29:44,683 --> 01:29:46,556
Close the blast doors.

998
01:29:53,692 --> 01:29:56,147
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.

999
01:30:14,546 --> 01:30:19,291
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

1000
01:30:20,093 --> 01:30:21,753
The circle is now complete.

1001
01:30:21,886 --> 01:30:24,045
When I left you,
I was but the learner.

1002
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:26,506
Now I am the master.

1003
01:30:26,641 --> 01:30:28,598
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1004
01:30:48,955 --> 01:30:51,197
Your powers are weak, old man.

1005
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:54,951
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

1006
01:30:55,086 --> 01:30:58,420
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1007
01:31:05,931 --> 01:31:07,888
You should not have come back.

1008
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:35,250
Didn't we just leave this party?

1009
01:31:38,088 --> 01:31:40,294
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

1010
01:31:40,423 --> 01:31:42,914
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

1011
01:31:43,051 --> 01:31:45,044
I hope the old man got
the tractor beam down.

1012
01:31:59,651 --> 01:32:00,814
Look.

1013
01:32:04,573 --> 01:32:06,530
Come on, R2. We're going.

1014
01:32:08,201 --> 01:32:09,232
Now's our chance. Go!

1015
01:32:39,441 --> 01:32:40,555
Come on!

1016
01:32:41,693 --> 01:32:43,104
Come on!

1017
01:32:43,236 --> 01:32:46,273
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!

1018
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:57,535
<i>Run, Luke, run.</i>

1019
01:33:00,795 --> 01:33:04,330
I hope that old man got the tractor beam
down, or this is gonna be a short trip.

1020
01:33:04,466 --> 01:33:05,924
Hit it!

1021
01:33:37,499 --> 01:33:39,373
We're coming up
on their sentry ships.

1022
01:33:39,501 --> 01:33:42,870
Hold them off. Angle the deflector
shields while I charge up the main guns.

1023
01:33:52,097 --> 01:33:54,054
I can't believe he's gone.

1024
01:33:57,686 --> 01:33:59,477
There wasn't anything
you could have done.

1025
01:34:00,313 --> 01:34:02,520
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.

1026
01:34:19,374 --> 01:34:21,663
You in, kid?
Okay, stay sharp.

1027
01:34:32,554 --> 01:34:33,633
Here they come.

1028
01:34:51,698 --> 01:34:53,525
They're coming in too fast!

1029
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:05,290
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.

1030
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,872
Hear me, baby?
Hold together.

1031
01:35:31,029 --> 01:35:32,571
Got him. I got him!

1032
01:35:32,697 --> 01:35:35,069
Great, kid.
Don't get cocky.

1033
01:35:36,284 --> 01:35:37,992
There's still two more.

1034
01:36:11,945 --> 01:36:14,436
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.

1035
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:18,196
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.

1036
01:36:26,042 --> 01:36:27,702
Are they away?

1037
01:36:27,836 --> 01:36:30,125
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1038
01:36:30,839 --> 01:36:34,208
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1039
01:36:35,468 --> 01:36:37,794
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1040
01:36:37,929 --> 01:36:39,838
This had better work.

1041
01:36:40,056 --> 01:36:42,132
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1042
01:36:42,892 --> 01:36:45,929
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.

1043
01:36:46,062 --> 01:36:48,351
That doesn't sound too hard.

1044
01:36:48,481 --> 01:36:52,100
They let us go. It's the only
explanation for the ease of our escape.

1045
01:36:52,235 --> 01:36:54,987
- You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.

1046
01:36:55,113 --> 01:36:56,856
Not this ship, sister.

1047
01:36:58,158 --> 01:37:00,649
At least the information in R2
is still intact.

1048
01:37:00,785 --> 01:37:03,193
What's so important?
What's he carrying?

1049
01:37:03,330 --> 01:37:05,488
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1050
01:37:06,541 --> 01:37:09,791
I only hope that when the data's
analysed a weakness can be found.

1051
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,253
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.

1052
01:37:13,381 --> 01:37:16,750
I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1053
01:37:16,885 --> 01:37:19,672
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

1054
01:37:19,804 --> 01:37:21,963
You needn't worry
about your reward.

1055
01:37:22,098 --> 01:37:24,969
If money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.

1056
01:37:28,188 --> 01:37:30,097
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1057
01:37:30,232 --> 01:37:33,398
I wonder if he really cares
about anything... or anybody.

1058
01:37:34,569 --> 01:37:36,028
I care.

1059
01:37:42,661 --> 01:37:44,238
So...

1060
01:37:44,371 --> 01:37:46,244
what do you
think of her, Han?

1061
01:37:46,373 --> 01:37:48,199
I'm trying not to, kid.

1062
01:37:49,084 --> 01:37:50,329
Good.

1063
01:37:53,755 --> 01:37:56,626
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1064
01:37:58,802 --> 01:38:01,838
What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me...

1065
01:38:01,972 --> 01:38:02,972
No.

1066
01:38:50,228 --> 01:38:53,395
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.

1067
01:38:53,523 --> 01:38:55,397
We have no time for sorrows,
Commander.

1068
01:38:55,525 --> 01:38:58,526
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.

1069
01:38:58,653 --> 01:39:00,610
It's our only hope.

1070
01:39:21,718 --> 01:39:24,387
- Yes.
- <i>We're approaching the planet Yavin.</i>

1071
01:39:24,512 --> 01:39:26,801
<i>The rebel base is on a moon</i>
<i>on the far side.</i>

1072
01:39:26,932 --> 01:39:28,889
<i>We are preparing</i>
<i>to orbit the planet.</i>

1073
01:39:37,901 --> 01:39:39,977
The battle station
is heavily shielded...

1074
01:39:40,111 --> 01:39:43,527
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.

1075
01:39:44,282 --> 01:39:48,327
Its defences are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1076
01:39:48,453 --> 01:39:53,660
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defence.

1077
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:59,244
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good
are snub fighters against that?

1078
01:39:59,381 --> 01:40:03,924
The Empire doesn't consider a small,
one-man fighter to be any threat...

1079
01:40:04,052 --> 01:40:06,009
or they'd have a tighter defence.

1080
01:40:06,888 --> 01:40:10,091
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

1081
01:40:10,225 --> 01:40:13,226
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1082
01:40:14,145 --> 01:40:16,055
The approach will not be easy.

1083
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:19,309
You're required to manoeuvre
straight down this trench...

1084
01:40:19,442 --> 01:40:22,016
and skim the surface to this point.

1085
01:40:22,904 --> 01:40:25,574
The target area
is only two metres wide.

1086
01:40:25,699 --> 01:40:29,317
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

1087
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:33,787
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1088
01:40:33,915 --> 01:40:36,620
A precise hit
will start a chain reaction...

1089
01:40:36,751 --> 01:40:38,958
which should destroy the station.

1090
01:40:39,087 --> 01:40:42,538
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1091
01:40:42,674 --> 01:40:45,794
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1092
01:40:45,927 --> 01:40:48,050
That's impossible,
even for a computer.

1093
01:40:48,179 --> 01:40:51,928
No, it's not. I used to bull's -eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1094
01:40:52,058 --> 01:40:54,430
They're not much bigger
than two metres.

1095
01:40:54,561 --> 01:40:57,728
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1096
01:41:05,989 --> 01:41:08,397
<i>Orbiting the planet</i>
<i>at maximum velocity.</i>

1097
01:41:09,242 --> 01:41:12,907
<i>The moon with the rebel base</i>
<i>will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>

1098
01:41:13,038 --> 01:41:15,611
This will be a day
long remembered.

1099
01:41:15,749 --> 01:41:17,706
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1100
01:41:17,834 --> 01:41:20,408
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion.

1101
01:41:26,176 --> 01:41:28,583
<i>All flight crews,</i>
<i>man your stations.</i>

1102
01:41:34,893 --> 01:41:37,977
So, you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1103
01:41:38,104 --> 01:41:40,062
That's right. Yeah.

1104
01:41:41,191 --> 01:41:43,764
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.

1105
01:41:43,902 --> 01:41:47,947
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be
fool enough to stick around here, do ya?

1106
01:41:48,073 --> 01:41:51,655
Why don't you come with us? You're
pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.

1107
01:41:51,785 --> 01:41:54,739
Come on. Why don't you
take a look around?

1108
01:41:54,871 --> 01:41:57,493
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.

1109
01:41:57,624 --> 01:42:00,433
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.

1110
01:42:00,533 --> 01:42:02,874
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1111
01:42:03,004 --> 01:42:05,922
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

1112
01:42:06,049 --> 01:42:08,884
It's more like... suicide.

1113
01:42:10,345 --> 01:42:13,548
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

1114
01:42:13,682 --> 01:42:16,303
I guess that's what you're best at,
isn't it?

1115
01:42:16,434 --> 01:42:17,715
Hey, Luke.

1116
01:42:21,106 --> 01:42:23,431
May the Force be with you.

1117
01:42:30,031 --> 01:42:33,151
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.

1118
01:42:37,581 --> 01:42:40,036
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1119
01:42:49,009 --> 01:42:51,250
- What's wrong?
- It's Han.

1120
01:42:51,386 --> 01:42:53,794
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1121
01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:57,382
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1122
01:42:58,476 --> 01:43:00,884
I only wish Ben were here.

1123
01:43:08,945 --> 01:43:10,985
<i>Open main launch tubes.</i>

1124
01:43:11,865 --> 01:43:13,822
<i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>

1125
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:15,610
Hey, Luke!

1126
01:43:15,744 --> 01:43:18,863
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?

1127
01:43:18,997 --> 01:43:21,036
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.

1128
01:43:21,166 --> 01:43:23,455
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.

1129
01:43:25,170 --> 01:43:27,044
Are you sure
you can handle this ship?

1130
01:43:27,172 --> 01:43:30,541
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.

1131
01:43:31,301 --> 01:43:33,792
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1132
01:43:33,929 --> 01:43:37,796
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?

1133
01:43:37,933 --> 01:43:40,602
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.

1134
01:43:40,727 --> 01:43:43,681
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.

1135
01:43:46,608 --> 01:43:49,478
This R2 unit of yours seems
a bit beat up. You want a new one?

1136
01:43:49,611 --> 01:43:52,731
Not on your life. That droid and I
have been through a lot.

1137
01:43:52,864 --> 01:43:53,864
You okay, R2?

1138
01:43:55,533 --> 01:43:56,909
Good.

1139
01:43:57,994 --> 01:44:00,699
<i>Gold squadron,</i>
<i>begin take-off procedure.</i>

1140
01:44:01,414 --> 01:44:04,368
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1141
01:44:06,294 --> 01:44:08,965
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1142
01:44:56,636 --> 01:44:59,590
<i>Luke, the Force will be with you.</i>

1143
01:45:11,693 --> 01:45:15,144
<i>Standby alert.</i>
<i>Death Star approaching.</i>

1144
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:18,364
<i>Estimated time to firing range,</i>
<i>15 minutes.</i>

1145
01:45:31,546 --> 01:45:33,753
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.

1146
01:45:33,882 --> 01:45:36,088
- <i>Red Seven standing by.</i>
- Red Three standing by.

1147
01:45:36,217 --> 01:45:38,922
- Red Six standing by.
- <i>Red Nine standing by.</i>

1148
01:45:39,054 --> 01:45:41,046
- Red Two standing by.
- <i>Red 11 standing by.</i>

1149
01:45:41,181 --> 01:45:43,055
Red Five standing by.

1150
01:45:44,476 --> 01:45:46,349
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1151
01:45:50,649 --> 01:45:52,606
<i>We're passing through</i>
<i>the magnetic field.</i>

1152
01:45:52,734 --> 01:45:55,486
Hold tight.
Switch your deflectors on.

1153
01:45:55,612 --> 01:45:57,023
<i>Double front.</i>

1154
01:46:00,075 --> 01:46:01,818
Look at the size of that thing.

1155
01:46:01,952 --> 01:46:04,525
<i>Cut the chatter, Red Two.</i>
<i>Accelerate to attack speed.</i>

1156
01:46:07,958 --> 01:46:10,662
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1157
01:46:10,794 --> 01:46:13,629
- <i>I copy, Gold Leader.</i>
- We're starting for the target shaft.

1158
01:46:13,755 --> 01:46:17,171
We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and draw their fire.

1159
01:46:31,648 --> 01:46:34,898
- <i>Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.</i>
- <i>I see it. Stay low.</i>

1160
01:46:42,367 --> 01:46:43,826
This is Red Five.
I'm going in.

1161
01:46:48,456 --> 01:46:49,456
<i>Luke, pull up!</i>

1162
01:46:51,376 --> 01:46:53,416
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.

1163
01:46:59,426 --> 01:47:03,340
We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so
small they're evading our turbolasers.

1164
01:47:03,471 --> 01:47:05,345
We'll have to destroy
them ship to ship.

1165
01:47:05,473 --> 01:47:07,466
Get the crews
to their fighters.

1166
01:47:10,048 --> 01:47:11,095
Watch yourself.

1167
01:47:11,195 --> 01:47:14,316
<i>There's a lot of fire coming from</i>
<i>the right side of that deflection tower.</i>

1168
01:47:14,416 --> 01:47:15,310
I'm on it.

1169
01:47:15,442 --> 01:47:18,811
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.

1170
01:47:25,243 --> 01:47:26,987
I've got a problem here.

1171
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:28,495
- Eject.
- I can hold it.

1172
01:47:28,622 --> 01:47:30,780
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right...

1173
01:47:35,003 --> 01:47:37,920
<i>The rebel base will be in firing range</i>
<i>in seven minutes.</i>

1174
01:47:41,801 --> 01:47:44,471
<i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>

1175
01:47:52,312 --> 01:47:53,890
Squad leaders...

1176
01:47:54,022 --> 01:47:56,061
we've picked up
a new group of signals.

1177
01:47:56,191 --> 01:47:58,065
Enemy fighters
coming your way.

1178
01:47:58,193 --> 01:47:59,873
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.

1179
01:47:59,986 --> 01:48:02,145
- Pick up your visual scanning.
- <i>Here they come.</i>

1180
01:48:05,450 --> 01:48:07,110
You've got one on your tail.

1181
01:48:12,499 --> 01:48:13,499
I'm hit!

1182
01:48:14,834 --> 01:48:17,325
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.

1183
01:48:19,381 --> 01:48:21,041
He's on me tight.
I can't shake him.

1184
01:48:22,801 --> 01:48:24,840
I'll be right there.

1185
01:48:37,065 --> 01:48:40,399
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1186
01:48:43,905 --> 01:48:46,990
- <i>Fall in. Fall in.</i>
- <i>Watch your back, Luke.</i>

1187
01:48:47,117 --> 01:48:49,405
<i>Fighters above you, coming in.</i>

1188
01:48:55,709 --> 01:48:58,460
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1189
01:48:58,587 --> 01:49:00,663
<i>Hang on back there.</i>

1190
01:49:00,797 --> 01:49:03,418
<i>Red Six, can you see Red Five?</i>

1191
01:49:03,550 --> 01:49:05,922
<i>There's a heavy fire zone.</i>
<i>Red Five, where are you?</i>

1192
01:49:06,052 --> 01:49:07,428
I can't shake him.

1193
01:49:11,516 --> 01:49:13,010
I'm on him, Luke.

1194
01:49:16,271 --> 01:49:17,848
Blast it, Biggs.
Where are you?

1195
01:49:24,905 --> 01:49:27,656
- Thanks, Wedge.
- <i>Good shooting, Wedge.</i>

1196
01:49:27,782 --> 01:49:30,867
<i>Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.</i>
<i>We're starting our attack run.</i>

1197
01:49:32,746 --> 01:49:35,071
<i>I copy, Gold Leader.</i>
<i>Move into position.</i>

1198
01:49:37,542 --> 01:49:39,784
Stay in attack formation.

1199
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,755
<i>The exhaust port</i>
<i>is marked and locked in.</i>

1200
01:49:48,637 --> 01:49:51,756
<i>Switch all power</i>
<i>to front deflector screen.</i>

1201
01:49:51,890 --> 01:49:55,093
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1202
01:49:59,814 --> 01:50:01,522
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?

1203
01:50:01,650 --> 01:50:04,853
<i>Say about 20 guns,</i>
<i>some on the surface, some on the towers.</i>

1204
01:50:04,986 --> 01:50:07,773
<i>Death Star will be in range</i>
<i>in five minutes.</i>

1205
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:12,950
Switch to targeting computer.

1206
01:50:15,455 --> 01:50:17,412
Computer's locked.
Getting a signal.

1207
01:50:19,834 --> 01:50:21,910
The guns. They've stopped.

1208
01:50:23,672 --> 01:50:26,163
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

1209
01:50:26,299 --> 01:50:28,707
<i>They're coming in.</i>
<i>Three marks at 210.</i>

1210
01:50:30,762 --> 01:50:32,885
I'll take them myself.
Cover me.

1211
01:50:33,014 --> 01:50:34,259
Yes, sir.

1212
01:50:48,822 --> 01:50:51,229
- It's no good. I can't manoeuvre.
- Stay on target.

1213
01:50:51,366 --> 01:50:53,193
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.

1214
01:50:55,036 --> 01:50:56,036
Loosen up!

1215
01:50:59,082 --> 01:51:01,834
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1216
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:04,285
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.

1217
01:51:10,677 --> 01:51:13,250
We've analysed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1218
01:51:13,388 --> 01:51:15,262
Should I have your ship
standing by?

1219
01:51:15,390 --> 01:51:18,261
Evacuate?
In our moment of triumph?

1220
01:51:18,393 --> 01:51:20,801
I think you overestimate
their chances.

1221
01:51:21,563 --> 01:51:23,520
<i>Rebel base,</i>
<i>three minutes and closing.</i>

1222
01:51:24,316 --> 01:51:26,107
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1223
01:51:26,234 --> 01:51:27,942
<i>Rendezvous at mark 6. 1.</i>

1224
01:51:28,069 --> 01:51:31,688
- <i>This is Red Two flying toward you.</i>
- <i>Red Three standing by.</i>

1225
01:51:31,823 --> 01:51:33,614
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1226
01:51:33,742 --> 01:51:36,363
<i>Keep half your group out of range</i>
<i>for the next run.</i>

1227
01:51:36,494 --> 01:51:39,068
<i>Copy, Base One.</i>
<i>Luke, take Red Two and Three.</i>

1228
01:51:39,205 --> 01:51:42,539
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1229
01:51:51,009 --> 01:51:52,172
This is it.

1230
01:51:56,765 --> 01:51:58,888
We should be able
to see it by now.

1231
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:02,268
Keep your eyes open
for those fighters.

1232
01:52:04,105 --> 01:52:06,478
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?

1233
01:52:06,608 --> 01:52:09,562
- No sign of any... Wait. Coming in.35.
- I see them.

1234
01:52:11,154 --> 01:52:12,233
I'm in range.

1235
01:52:13,531 --> 01:52:15,239
Target's coming up.

1236
01:52:17,827 --> 01:52:19,903
Just hold them off
for a few seconds.

1237
01:52:20,789 --> 01:52:22,331
Close up formation.

1238
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:25,908
Almost there.

1239
01:52:35,011 --> 01:52:38,261
- Let her loose. They're right behind me.
- Almost there.

1240
01:52:39,641 --> 01:52:41,265
I can't hold them.

1241
01:52:49,526 --> 01:52:50,526
It's away!

1242
01:52:54,781 --> 01:52:56,359
<i>- It's a hit!</i>
<i>- Negative.</i>

1243
01:52:56,491 --> 01:52:58,531
Negative. It didn't go in.

1244
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:01,281
<i>It just impacted on the surface.</i>

1245
01:53:07,794 --> 01:53:09,419
<i>Red Leader, we're right above you.</i>

1246
01:53:09,546 --> 01:53:11,704
Turn to.05.
We'll cover for you.

1247
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:14,710
<i>Stay there. I just lost</i>
<i>my starboard engine.</i>

1248
01:53:15,552 --> 01:53:17,794
<i>Get set up for your attack run.</i>

1249
01:53:31,151 --> 01:53:33,689
<i>Rebel base, one minute and closing.</i>

1250
01:53:34,487 --> 01:53:36,030
<i>Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.</i>

1251
01:53:36,156 --> 01:53:39,489
<i>We're going in full throttle. That ought</i>
<i>to keep those fighters off our back.</i>

1252
01:53:39,701 --> 01:53:41,694
Right with you, boss.

1253
01:53:41,828 --> 01:53:44,126
Luke, at that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?

1254
01:53:44,226 --> 01:53:46,163
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1255
01:53:53,548 --> 01:53:55,755
We'll stay back
far enough to cover you.

1256
01:53:55,884 --> 01:53:58,422
<i>My scope shows the tower,</i>
<i>but I can't see the exhaust port.</i>

1257
01:53:58,553 --> 01:54:00,033
Are you sure
the computer can hit it?

1258
01:54:03,516 --> 01:54:05,474
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1259
01:54:05,602 --> 01:54:06,847
What about that tower?

1260
01:54:06,978 --> 01:54:09,652
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.

1261
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:19,355
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose
again. See if you can't lock it down.

1262
01:54:28,583 --> 01:54:30,327
<i>Fighters coming in.3.</i>

1263
01:54:39,302 --> 01:54:41,758
- <i>I'm hit. I can't stay with you.</i>
- <i>Get clear, Wedge.</i>

1264
01:54:41,888 --> 01:54:44,344
- You can't do any more good back there.
- Sorry.

1265
01:54:45,433 --> 01:54:47,343
Let him go.
Stay on the leader.

1266
01:54:50,355 --> 01:54:52,561
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.

1267
01:54:56,736 --> 01:54:59,406
R2, try and increase the power.

1268
01:55:04,828 --> 01:55:06,026
<i>Hurry up, Luke. Quick.</i>

1269
01:55:06,997 --> 01:55:08,076
Quick.

1270
01:55:15,171 --> 01:55:17,662
<i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>

1271
01:55:17,799 --> 01:55:18,878
I'm on the leader.

1272
01:55:22,387 --> 01:55:23,798
Hang on, R2.

1273
01:55:39,279 --> 01:55:41,817
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

1274
01:55:44,492 --> 01:55:47,114
<i>Let go, Luke.</i>

1275
01:55:48,580 --> 01:55:50,905
The Force is strong with this one.

1276
01:55:51,041 --> 01:55:52,950
<i>Luke, trust me.</i>

1277
01:55:58,173 --> 01:55:59,964
<i>His computer's off.</i>

1278
01:56:00,091 --> 01:56:02,548
<i>You switched off your</i>
<i>targeting computer. What's wrong?</i>

1279
01:56:02,648 --> 01:56:04,882
<i>Nothing. I'm all right.</i>

1280
01:56:17,901 --> 01:56:19,099
<i>I've lost R2.</i>

1281
01:56:21,029 --> 01:56:23,069
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1282
01:56:23,198 --> 01:56:25,487
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1283
01:56:26,576 --> 01:56:28,154
<i>Rebel base in range.</i>

1284
01:56:28,286 --> 01:56:30,160
You may fire when ready.

1285
01:56:30,914 --> 01:56:32,325
<i>Commence primary ignition.</i>

1286
01:56:46,346 --> 01:56:47,721
I have you now.

1287
01:56:50,225 --> 01:56:51,339
What?

1288
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:55,020
Look out.

1289
01:57:01,695 --> 01:57:04,482
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.

1290
01:57:11,371 --> 01:57:12,651
<i>Stand by.</i>

1291
01:57:15,709 --> 01:57:17,369
<i>Stand by.</i>

1292
01:57:27,887 --> 01:57:29,761
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1293
01:57:31,266 --> 01:57:35,643
<i>Remember, the Force</i>
<i>will be with you always.</i>

1294
01:58:01,129 --> 01:58:03,003
I just knew you'd come back.

1295
01:58:03,131 --> 01:58:05,653
I wasn't gonna let you get all
the credit and take all the reward.

1296
01:58:05,753 --> 01:58:07,591
I knew there was
more to you than money.

1297
01:58:08,303 --> 01:58:09,548
Oh, no.

1298
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:12,087
Oh, my.
R2, can you hear me?

1299
01:58:12,807 --> 01:58:15,643
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1300
01:58:15,769 --> 01:58:18,972
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.

1301
01:58:19,105 --> 01:58:21,945
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

1302
01:58:22,108 --> 01:58:24,066
He'll be all right.
