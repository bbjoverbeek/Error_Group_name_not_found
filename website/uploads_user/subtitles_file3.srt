1
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:54,819
<i>Once upon a time there
was a lovely princess.</i>

2
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:58,658
<i>But she had an enchantment
upon her of a fearful sort...</i>

3
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,618
<i>which could only be broken
by love's first kiss.</i>

4
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:06,038
<i>She was locked away
in a castle...</i>

5
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,339
<i>guarded by a terrible
fire-breathing dragon.</i>

6
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:14,798
<i>Many brave knights had attempted to
free her from this dreadful prison,</i>

7
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,628
<i>but none prevailed.</i>

8
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,889
<i>She waited in the dragon's
keep...</i>

9
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:22,889
<i>in the highest room of
the tallest tower...</i>

10
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:27,518
<i>for her true love and
true love's first kiss.</i>

11
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,559
Like that's ever gonna happen.

12
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:34,399
What a load of...

13
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:39,068
<i>Somebody once told me the
world is gonna roll me</i>

14
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,118
<i>I am not the sharpest
tool in the shed</i>

15
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:48,119
<i>She was looking kind of dumb
with her finger and her thumb</i>

16
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:51,919
<i>In the shape of an L
on her forehead</i>

17
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:54,919
<i>The years start coming and
they don't stop coming</i>

18
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:57,838
<i>Fed to the rules and
I hit the ground running</i>

19
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,179
<i>Didn't make sense not
to live for fun</i>

20
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:02,469
<i>Your brain gets smart but
your head gets dumb</i>

21
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,469
<i>So much to do, so much to see</i>

22
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:07,139
<i>So what's wrong with
taking the backstreets</i>

23
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,268
<i>You'll never know
if you don't go</i>

24
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,808
<i>You'll never shine
if you don't glow</i>

25
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,819
<i>Hey, now, you're an all-star</i>

26
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:16,278
<i>Get your game on, go play</i>

27
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:20,278
<i>Hey, now, you're a rock star,
get the show on, get paid</i>

28
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:24,328
<i>And all that glitters is gold</i>

29
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:29,828
<i>Only shooting stars
break the mould</i>

30
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,919
<i>It's a cool place and
they say it gets colder</i>

31
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:34,168
<i>You're bundled up now but
wait till you get older</i>

32
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:36,379
<i>But the meteor men
beg to differ</i>

33
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:38,379
<i>Judging by the hole in
the satellite picture</i>

34
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:41,178
<i>The ice we skate is
getting pretty thin</i>

35
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,298
<i>The water's getting warm
so you might as well swim</i>

36
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:45,219
<i>My world's on fire,
how about yours</i>

37
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:47,968
<i>That's the way I like it
and I'll never get bored</i>

38
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:50,689
<i>Hey, now, you're an all-star</i>

39
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,524
<i>Get your game on, go play</i>

40
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:57,569
<i>Hey, now, you're a rock star,
get the show on, get paid</i>

41
00:02:57,649 --> 00:03:01,359
<i>And all that glitters is gold</i>

42
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:06,369
<i>Only shooting stars
break the mould</i>

43
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,208
- Go!
- Go!

44
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:15,419
<i>Go. Go. Go.</i>

45
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:18,048
<i>Hey, now, you're an all-star</i>

46
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:21,218
<i>Get your game on, go play</i>

47
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:25,549
<i>Hey, now, you're a rock star,
get the show on, get paid</i>

48
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:29,518
<i>And all that glitters is gold</i>

49
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,899
<i>Only shooting stars
break the mould</i>

50
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:42,859
- Think it's in there?
- All right. Let's get it!

51
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:45,699
Whoa. Hold on. Do you know
what that thing can do to you?

52
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:48,739
Yeah, it'll grind your
bones for its bread.

53
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:52,788
Yes, well, actually,
that would be a giant.

54
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:56,919
Now, ogres...
they're much worse.

55
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,918
They'll make a suit from
your freshly peeled skin.

56
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,088
- No!
- They'll shave your liver.

57
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:05,429
Squeeze the jelly
from your eyes!

58
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:08,048
- Actually, it's quite good on toast.
- Back! Back, beast!

59
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:10,268
Back! I warn ya!

60
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:16,559
Right.

61
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:35,959
This is the part where
you run away.

62
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:45,799
And stay out!

63
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:50,759
Wanted. Fairy tale creatures.

64
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:58,649
All right. This one's full.

65
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:01,359
Take it away!

66
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:05,318
- Move it along. Come on! Get up!
- Next!

67
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:08,319
Give me that!
Your flying days are over.

68
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:11,029
That's 20 pieces of silver
for the witch. Next!

69
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:13,829
- Get up! Come on!
- Twenty pieces.

70
00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:16,288
Sit down there!

71
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:18,879
Keep quiet!

72
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,839
This cage is too small.

73
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,039
Please don't turn me in. I'll
never be stubborn again.

74
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,089
I can change. Please!
Give me another chance!

75
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:28,549
- Oh, shut up.
- Next!

76
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:31,509
- What have you got?
- This little wooden puppet.

77
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:36,519
I'm not a puppet.
I'm a real boy.

78
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:38,979
Five shillings for
the possessed toy.

79
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:41,149
- Take it away.
- Father, please! Don't let them do this!

80
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:43,149
- Next. What have you got?
- Help me!

81
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:45,859
Well, I've got a talking donkey.

82
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:50,488
Right. Well, that's good for ten
shillings, if you can prove it.

83
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:54,489
Oh, go ahead, little fella.

84
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:56,498
Well?

85
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,289
Oh, he's just...
he's just a little nervous.

86
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:03,339
He's really quite a chatterbox.
Talk, you bone headed dolt...

87
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,009
- That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
- No, no, he talks!

88
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:10,218
He does.
I can talk. I love to talk.

89
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:13,218
I'm the talkingest damn
thing you ever saw.

90
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:15,849
- Get her out of my sight.
- No, no!

91
00:06:15,928 --> 00:06:20,348
I swear! He can talk!

92
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:25,069
Hey! I can fly!

93
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,779
- He can fly!
- He can fly!

94
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:29,909
- He can talk!
- That's right, fool!

95
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:32,238
Now I'm a flying,
talking donkey.

96
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,948
You might have seen a house fly,
maybe even a super fly,

97
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,079
but I bet you ain't never
seen a donkey fly.

98
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,419
Seize him!

99
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:51,219
After him! He's getting away!

100
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:02,268
Get him! This way! Turn!

101
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,779
You there. Ogre!

102
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:12,158
Aye?

103
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:14,272
By the order of Lord
Farquaad, I am...

104
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:16,328
authorised to place you
both under arrest...

105
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:21,998
and transport you to a designated
resettlement facility.

106
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,129
Oh, really?
You and what army?

107
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,888
Can I say something to you?

108
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:42,308
Listen, you was really, really
something back there. Incredible!

109
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:47,106
Are you talking to me?

110
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:50,202
Yes, I was talking to you.
Can I just tell you

111
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:52,198
that you was great back there?
Those guards!

112
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,989
They thought they was all of that.
Then you showed up, and bam!

113
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,028
They was tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

114
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,039
That really made me
feel good to see that.

115
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:02,158
- Oh, that's great. Really.
- Man, it's good to be free.

116
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:07,789
Now, why don't you go celebrate your
freedom with your own friends? Hmm?

117
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,168
But I don't have any friends.

118
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:13,928
And I'm not going out
there by myself.

119
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:16,549
Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea!
I'll stick with you.

120
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:18,559
You're a mean, green,
fighting machine.

121
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:21,039
Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.

122
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:27,899
Oh, wow! That was
really scary.

123
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:29,821
If you don't mind me saying,
if that don't work,

124
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,689
your breath certainly
will get the job done,

125
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,988
'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs
or something, 'cause your breath stinks!

126
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:38,199
You almost burned the
hair outta my nose,

127
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,119
just like the time...

128
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:44,919
Then I ate some rotten berries. I had
strong gases eking out of my butt that day.

129
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:47,709
Why are you following me?

130
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:51,378
I'll tell you why.

131
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:54,378
<i>'Cause I'm all alone</i>

132
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:58,219
<i>There's no one here beside me</i>

133
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:00,926
<i>My problems have all gone</i>

134
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:05,388
<i>There's no one to deride me</i>

135
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,438
<i>But you gotta have friends...</i>

136
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:10,568
Stop singing!

137
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:12,688
It's no wonder you don't
have any friends.

138
00:09:13,822 --> 00:09:16,398
Only a true friend would be
that truly honest.

139
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:20,578
Listen, little donkey.
Take a look at me. What am I?

140
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,708
- Really tall?
- No! I'm an ogre.

141
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:31,999
You know. Grab your torch
and pitchforks.

142
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,089
Doesn't that bother you?

143
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:36,298
Nope.

144
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,258
- Really?
- Really, really.

145
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,469
Man, I like you.
What's your name?

146
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:46,229
Shrek.

147
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:49,558
Shrek? Well, you know what
I like about you, Shrek?

148
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:50,718
You got that kind of...

149
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:53,689
I-don't-care-what-nobody
thinks-of-me thing.

150
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:57,568
I like that. I respect that, Shrek.
You all right.

151
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:01,659
Look at that. Who'd want to live
in a place like that?

152
00:10:01,738 --> 00:10:04,949
That would be my home.

153
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,909
And it is lovely!
Just beautiful.

154
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,789
You are quite a decorator. It's amazing
what you've done with such a modest budget.

155
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,629
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.

156
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:23,099
I guess you don't
entertain much, do you?

157
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:24,969
I like my privacy.

158
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,639
You know, I do too. That's
another thing we have in common.

159
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:29,979
Like, I hate it when you
got somebody in your face.

160
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:32,007
You're trying to give them a
hint, and they won't leave.

161
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,979
There's that awkward silence.

162
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:39,819
- Can I stay with you?
- What?

163
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:42,488
Can I stay with you, please?

164
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:44,869
- Of course!
- Really?

165
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:47,329
- No.
- Please! I don't wanna go back there!

166
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:51,328
You don't know what it's like to be
considered a freak. Well, maybe you do.

167
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,999
But that's why we gotta stick together.
You gotta let me stay!

168
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:57,208
- Please! Please!
- Okay! Okay!

169
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:59,879
- But one night only.
- Thank you!

170
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:02,299
- What are you... No! No!
- This is gonna be fun!

171
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:04,299
We can stay up late,
swapping manly stories,

172
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:07,179
and in the morning
I'm making waffles.

173
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:10,518
Where do I sleep?

174
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:12,348
Outside!

175
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,518
Oh, well, I guess that's cool.

176
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,689
I mean, I don't know you,
and you don't know me,

177
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,149
so I guess outside
is best, you know.

178
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:23,238
Here I go.

179
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:28,456
Good night.

180
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,567
I mean, I do like the outdoors.
I'm a donkey.

181
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,579
I was born outside.

182
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:36,339
I'll just be sitting by myself
outside, I guess, you know.

183
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:38,709
By myself, outside.

184
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,589
I'm all alone, there's
no one here beside me.

185
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:50,489
I thought I told you
to stay outside.

186
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:54,249
I am outside.

187
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:03,549
Well, gents, it's a far cry from the
farm, but what choice do we have?

188
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:06,129
It's not home, but
it'll do just fine.

189
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,139
What a lovely bed.

190
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:10,559
- Got ya.
- I found some cheese.

191
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:13,139
Awful stuff.

192
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:17,479
- Is that you, Gorder?
- How did you know?

193
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:20,478
Enough! What are you
doing in my house?

194
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:22,478
Hey!

195
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,199
Oh, no, no, no.

196
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,062
Dead broad off the table.

197
00:13:27,075 --> 00:13:28,869
Where are we supposed to put her?
The bed's taken.

198
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:34,828
What?

199
00:13:34,908 --> 00:13:39,668
I live in a swamp. I put up signs.
I'm a terrifying ogre!

200
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:42,378
What do I have to do to
get a little privacy?

201
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,879
Oh, no.

202
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:47,679
Oh, no.

203
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,349
No! No!

204
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:54,349
What?

205
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:56,349
- Quit it.
- Don't push.

206
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:03,688
What are you doing
in my swamp?

207
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:09,489
Oh, dear!

208
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,659
All right, get out of here.
All of you, move it!

209
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:17,159
Come on! Let's go! Hapaya!
Hapaya! Hey!

210
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:19,209
- Quickly. Come on!
- No, no!

211
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:21,499
No, no. Not there. Not there.

212
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:28,049
Hey, don't look at me.
I didn't invite them.

213
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:30,219
Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

214
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:32,888
- What?
- We were forced to come here.

215
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:35,099
- By who?
- Lord Farquaad.

216
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:39,939
He huffed und he puffed und he
signed an eviction notice.

217
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:42,728
All right.

218
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:47,069
Who knows where this
Farquaad guy is?

219
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:49,949
Oh, I do. I know where he is.

220
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:53,738
Does anyone else know
where to find him?

221
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,448
- Any one at all?
- Me! Me!

222
00:14:57,539 --> 00:14:59,459
- Anyone?
- Oh, pick me!

223
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:01,959
Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!

224
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:05,168
Okay, fine.

225
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:09,799
Attention, all
fairy tale things.

226
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:14,599
Do not get comfortable. Your
welcome is officially worn out.

227
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:18,389
In fact, I'm gonna see this
guy Farquaad right now...

228
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:21,598
and get you all off my land
and back where you came from!

229
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:32,109
Oh! You!

230
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,118
You're coming with me.

231
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:36,538
All right, that's what
I like to hear, man.

232
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:40,409
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends,
off on a whirlwind big-city adventure.

233
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:42,498
I love it!

234
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:45,749
On the road again...
Sing it with me, Shrek.

235
00:15:45,838 --> 00:15:47,799
I can't wait to get
on the road again.

236
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,798
What did I say about singing?

237
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,798
- Can I whistle?
- No.

238
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,678
- Can I hum it?
- All right, hum it.

239
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:27,499
That's enough.
He's ready to talk.

240
00:16:40,428 --> 00:16:42,889
Run, run, run, as
fast as you can.

241
00:16:42,979 --> 00:16:46,519
You can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man!

242
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:50,189
- You're a monster.
- I'm not the monster here. You are.

243
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,529
You and the rest of that fairy tale
trash, poisoning my perfect world.

244
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:56,529
Now, tell me!
Where are the others?

245
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:59,158
Eat me!

246
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:02,158
I've tried to be fair
to you creatures.

247
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:05,748
Now my patience has reached
its end! Tell me or I'll...

248
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:08,628
No, no, not the buttons.
Not my gumdrop buttons.

249
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,708
All right then.
Who's hiding them?

250
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,128
Okay, I'll tell you.
Do you know the muffin man?

251
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:18,549
- The muffin man?
- The muffin man.

252
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:22,058
Yes, I know the muffin man,
who lives on Drury Lane?

253
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:25,559
Well, she's married
to the muffin man.

254
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:27,768
- The muffin man?
- The muffin man!

255
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:30,859
She's married to the muffin man.

256
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:32,608
My Lord! We found it.

257
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:35,898
Then what are you waiting for?
Bring it in.

258
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:54,208
- Magic mirror...
- Don't tell him anything!

259
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,628
No!

260
00:17:56,719 --> 00:18:00,469
Evening.

261
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:02,429
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

262
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:05,889
Is this not the most perfect
kingdom of them all?

263
00:18:05,978 --> 00:18:08,559
Well, technically
you're not a king.

264
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:11,026
Thelonius.

265
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:15,779
- You were saying?
- What I mean is, you're not a king yet.

266
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:19,449
But you can become one. All you
have to do is marry a princess.

267
00:18:19,528 --> 00:18:22,529
Go on.

268
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:26,248
So, just sit back
and relax, my Lord,

269
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:30,629
because it's time for you to meet
today's eligible bachelorettes.

270
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:34,298
And here they are!

271
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:39,339
Bachelorette number one is a mentally
abused shut-in from a kingdom far, faraway.

272
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:41,678
She likes Sushi and
hot tubbing anytime.

273
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,218
Her hobbies include cooking and
cleaning for her two evil sisters.

274
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:47,678
Please welcome Cinderella.

275
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:51,808
Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing
girl from the land of fancy.

276
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:54,609
Although she lives with seven
other men, she's not easy.

277
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:58,149
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and
find out what a live wire she is.

278
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:01,988
Come on. Give it
up for Snow White!

279
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,698
And last, but
certainly not least,

280
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:06,868
bachelorette number three
is a fiery redhead...

281
00:19:06,949 --> 00:19:09,499
from a dragon-guarded castle
surrounded by hot boiling lava!

282
00:19:09,578 --> 00:19:11,628
But don't let that cool you off.

283
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,878
She's a loaded pistol who likes pina
coladas and getting caught in the rain.

284
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:19,008
Yours for the rescuing,
Princess Fiona!

285
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:21,549
So will it be
bachelorette number one,

286
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:25,139
bachelorette number two or
bachelorette number three?

287
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:27,389
- Two! Two!
- Three! Three!

288
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:28,809
- Two! Two!
- Three!

289
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:31,018
Three? One? Three?

290
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:33,149
Three! Pick number
three, my Lord!

291
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:36,979
Okay, okay, number three!

292
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:41,819
Lord Farquaad, you've
chosen Princess Fiona.

293
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:45,699
<i>If you love pina coladas</i>

294
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:49,119
<i>- And getting caught in the rain</i>
- Princess Fiona.

295
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:51,369
<i>- If you're not into yoga</i>
- She's perfect.

296
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:54,208
All I have to do is just
find someone who can go...

297
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:56,549
But I probably should mention the
little thing that happens at night.

298
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,549
- I'll do it.
- Yes, but after sunset...

299
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:02,719
Silence! I will make this
Princess Fiona my queen,

300
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,969
and DuLoc will finally
have the perfect king!

301
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:09,269
Captain, assemble
your finest men.

302
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:13,228
We're going to
have a tournament.

303
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:17,899
But that's it. That's it right there.
That's DuLoc.

304
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:20,029
I told ya I'd find it.

305
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:24,238
So, that must be Lord
Farquaad's castle.

306
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,409
That's the place.

307
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:29,908
Do you think maybe he's
compensating for something?

308
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:36,128
Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

309
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:39,088
Hurry, darling. We're late.
Hurry.

310
00:20:40,668 --> 00:20:44,219
Hey, you!

311
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:47,138
Wait a second. Look,
I'm not gonna eat ya.

312
00:20:47,218 --> 00:20:51,139
I just... I just...

313
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:23,259
It's quiet.

314
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,969
Too quiet.

315
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,678
- Where is everybody?
- Hey, look at this!

316
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:51,489
<i>Welcome to DuLoc
such a perfect town</i>

317
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:54,999
<i>Here we have some rules,
let us lay them down</i>

318
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:58,959
<i>Don't make waves, stay in line
and we'll get along fine</i>

319
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,669
<i>DuLoc is a perfect place</i>

320
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:07,298
<i>Please keep off of the grass,
shine your shoes, wipe your face</i>

321
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:10,969
<i>DuLoc is, DuLoc is...</i>

322
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:16,604
<i>DuLoc is a perfect place</i>

323
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:25,989
Wow! Let's do that again!

324
00:22:26,068 --> 00:22:28,739
No. No. No, no, no! No.

325
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:33,538
Brave knights.

326
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:36,714
You are the best and
brightest in all the land.

327
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:40,249
Today one of you shall
prove himself...

328
00:22:40,328 --> 00:22:42,668
All right. You're going the
right way for a smacked bottom.

329
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:44,669
Sorry about that.

330
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:50,259
That champion shall have the honour,
no, no, the privilege...

331
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:54,388
to go forth and rescue the
lovely Princess Fiona...

332
00:22:54,469 --> 00:22:57,808
from the fiery keep
of the dragon.

333
00:22:57,889 --> 00:23:02,108
If for any reason the
winner is unsuccessful,

334
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:05,359
the first runner-up
will take his place...

335
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:08,239
and so on and so forth.

336
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:13,739
Some of you may die, but it's a
sacrifice I am willing to make.

337
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:21,289
Let the tournament begin!

338
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:30,258
What is that?

339
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:34,929
- It's hideous!
- That's not very nice.

340
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:37,429
It's just a donkey.

341
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,479
Indeed. Knights, new plan!

342
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:45,268
The one who kills the ogre will
be named champion! Have at him!

343
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,278
- Get him!
- Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now.

344
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,659
Go ahead! Get him!

345
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:55,409
Can't we just settle
this over a pint?

346
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:56,739
Kill the beast!

347
00:23:56,829 --> 00:24:01,288
No? All right then.

348
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:03,458
Come on!

349
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:15,679
<i>I don't give a damn
about my reputation</i>

350
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,351
<i>You're living in the past,
it's a new generation</i>

351
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:22,639
<i>A girl can do what
she wants to do</i>

352
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:24,979
<i>And that's what I'm gonna do</i>

353
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:28,979
<i>And I don't give a damn
about my bad reputation</i>

354
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:32,819
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
not me</i>

355
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:36,279
Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

356
00:24:36,368 --> 00:24:38,493
<i>And I don't give a damn
about my reputation</i>

357
00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:41,761
<i>Never said I wanted to
improve my station</i>

358
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,169
<i>And I'm always feeling good
when I'm having fun</i>

359
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:48,339
<i>And I don't have
to please no one</i>

360
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,338
The chair! Give him the chair!

361
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:52,631
<i>And I don't give a damn
about my bad reputation</i>

362
00:24:53,129 --> 00:24:56,299
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
not me</i>

363
00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:00,559
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no</i>

364
00:25:00,638 --> 00:25:04,309
<i>Not me, not me</i>

365
00:25:04,389 --> 00:25:06,859
<i>Not me</i>

366
00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:11,028
Oh, yeah!

367
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,068
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

368
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,538
I'm here till Thursday.
Try the veal!

369
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:28,958
Shall I give the order, sir?

370
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,629
No, I have a better idea.

371
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:37,889
People of DuLoc,
I give you our champion!

372
00:25:37,968 --> 00:25:41,848
- What?
- Congratulations, ogre.

373
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:46,268
You've won the honour of embarking
on a great and noble quest.

374
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:50,729
Quest? I'm already on a quest,
a quest to get my swamp back.

375
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:54,029
- Your swamp?
- Yeah, my swamp!

376
00:25:54,108 --> 00:25:56,568
Where you dumped those
fairy tale creatures!

377
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:59,239
Indeed.

378
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,408
All right, ogre,
I'll make you a deal.

379
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:05,288
Go on this quest for me, and
I'll give you your swamp back.

380
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:08,079
Exactly the way it was?

381
00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:10,919
Down to the last
slime-covered toad stool.

382
00:26:10,998 --> 00:26:14,259
- And the squatters?
- As good as gone.

383
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:21,258
What kind of quest?

384
00:26:21,598 --> 00:26:23,929
Let me get this straight.
You're gonna go fight a dragon...

385
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:26,727
and rescue a princess just so Farquaad
will give you back a swamp...

386
00:26:26,728 --> 00:26:29,938
which you only don't have because he filled
it full of freaks in the first place.

387
00:26:29,939 --> 00:26:31,679
Is that about right?

388
00:26:31,693 --> 00:26:34,279
Maybe there's a good reason
donkeys shouldn't talk.

389
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,899
I don't get it. Why don't you just
pull some of that ogre stuff on him?

390
00:26:37,989 --> 00:26:39,908
Throttle him, lay siege
to his fortress,

391
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:42,829
grind his bones to make your
bread, the whole ogre trip.

392
00:26:42,908 --> 00:26:44,829
Oh, I know what.

393
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:47,119
Maybe I could have decapitated
an entire village...

394
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,328
and put their heads on a pike,

395
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:53,039
gotten a knife, cut open their
spleen and drink their fluids.

396
00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:55,259
Does that sound good to you?

397
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,969
No, not really, no.

398
00:26:58,048 --> 00:27:01,849
For your information, there's a lot
more to ogres than people think.

399
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:04,679
- Example?
- Example?

400
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:10,899
- Okay, ogres are like onions.
- They stink?

401
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:13,269
- Yes... No! No!
- They make you cry?

402
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:16,778
You leave them out in the sun, they get all
brown, start sprouting little white hairs.

403
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:18,859
No! Layers!

404
00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:21,279
Onions have layers.

405
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:24,658
Ogres have layers!
Onions have layers.

406
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:27,159
You get it? We both have layers.

407
00:27:29,078 --> 00:27:32,251
Oh, you both have layers.

408
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:36,129
You know, not everybody likes onions.

409
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,839
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
Cakes have layers.

410
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:42,839
I don't care what
everyone likes.

411
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:46,639
Ogres are not like cakes.

412
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:51,849
You know what else everybody
likes? Parfaits.

413
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:53,858
Have you ever met a person, you
say, let's get some parfait,

414
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,858
they say, no, I don't
like no parfait?

415
00:27:55,938 --> 00:27:58,168
- Parfaits are delicious.
- No!

416
00:27:58,257 --> 00:28:01,528
You dense, irritating,
miniature beast of burden!

417
00:28:01,609 --> 00:28:04,528
Ogres are like onions!
End of story. Bye-bye.

418
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,578
See ya later.

419
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:14,839
Parfaits may be the most delicious
thing on the whole damn planet.

420
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:17,128
You know, I think
I preferred your humming.

421
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:19,879
Do you have a tissue or something?
I'm making a mess.

422
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:22,879
Just the word parfait
make me start slobbering.

423
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:33,188
<i>I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today</i>

424
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:41,318
<i>I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today</i>

425
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:47,868
<i>And everything that you
receive up yonder</i>

426
00:28:47,949 --> 00:28:51,868
<i>Is what you give to
me the day I wander</i>

427
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:54,918
<i>I'm on my way</i>

428
00:28:55,998 --> 00:28:58,919
<i>I'm on my way</i>

429
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:02,089
<i>I'm on my way</i>

430
00:29:02,168 --> 00:29:04,629
Ooh! Shrek! Did you do that?

431
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:08,509
You gotta warn somebody before you
just crack one off. My mouth was open.

432
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:12,308
Believe me, Donkey, if it
was me, you'd be dead.

433
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:15,149
It's brimstone.

434
00:29:15,229 --> 00:29:18,399
- We must be getting close.
- Yeah, right, brimstone.

435
00:29:18,478 --> 00:29:20,511
Don't be talking about
it's the brimstone.

436
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,569
I know what I smell.
It wasn't no brimstone.

437
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:24,608
It didn't come off no stone neither.

438
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:45,968
Sure, it's big enough, but
look at the location.

439
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:53,808
Shrek? Remember when
you said ogres have layers?

440
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:55,808
Oh, aye.

441
00:29:55,888 --> 00:29:59,479
Well, I have a bit of
a confession to make.

442
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:02,938
Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our
fear right out there on our sleeves.

443
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:05,057
Wait a second. Donkeys
don't have sleeves.

444
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,109
You know what I mean.

445
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:09,869
You can't tell me you're
afraid of heights.

446
00:30:09,948 --> 00:30:12,232
I'm just a little uncomfortable
about being on

447
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:14,538
a rickety bridge over a
boiling lake of lava!

448
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:18,669
Come on, Donkey. I'm right
here beside ya, okay?

449
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:21,418
For emotional support,

450
00:30:21,498 --> 00:30:26,049
we'll just tackle this thing together
one little baby step at a time.

451
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:28,049
- Really?
- Really, really.

452
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:31,349
- Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
- Just keep moving.

453
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:36,018
- And don't look down.
- Okay, don't look down. Don't look down.

454
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:39,479
Don't look down. Keep on moving.
Don't look down.

455
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:43,359
Shrek! I'm looking down!

456
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:46,359
Oh, God, I can't do this!
Just let me off, please!

457
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:49,988
- But you're already halfway.
- But I know that half is safe!

458
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:52,868
Okay, fine. I don't have time for this.
You go back.

459
00:30:52,949 --> 00:30:55,369
- Shrek, no! Wait!
- Just, Donkey...

460
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:58,539
- Let's have a dance then, shall we?
- Don't do that!

461
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:02,499
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

462
00:31:02,588 --> 00:31:05,669
- Oh, this?
- Yes, that!

463
00:31:05,758 --> 00:31:09,178
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

464
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:11,548
No, Shrek!

465
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:14,759
- No! Stop it!
- You said do it! I'm doing it.

466
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:19,099
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Shrek, I'm gonna die.

467
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:25,778
That'll do, Donkey.
That'll do.

468
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:30,366
Cool.

469
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:34,239
So where is this fire-breathing
pain-in-the-neck anyway?

470
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:38,079
Inside, waiting for
us to rescue her.

471
00:31:38,158 --> 00:31:41,079
I was talking about
the dragon, Shrek.

472
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,479
You afraid?

473
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,432
No, but...

474
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:05,478
Oh, good. Me neither.

475
00:32:05,569 --> 00:32:08,939
'Cause there's nothing
wrong with being afraid.

476
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:12,279
Fear's a sensible response
to an unfamiliar situation.

477
00:32:12,358 --> 00:32:14,409
Unfamiliar dangerous
situation, I might add.

478
00:32:14,488 --> 00:32:17,197
With a dragon that breathes fire and
eats knights and breathes fire,

479
00:32:17,198 --> 00:32:20,659
it sure doesn't mean you're a
coward if you're a little scared.

480
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:24,749
I sure as heck am not a coward.
I know that.

481
00:32:24,838 --> 00:32:28,169
Donkey, two things, okay?

482
00:32:28,258 --> 00:32:30,798
Shut up.

483
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:33,639
Now go over there and see
if you can find any stairs.

484
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:36,349
Stairs? I thought we was
looking for the princess.

485
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:41,309
The princess will be up the stairs in
the highest room in the tallest tower.

486
00:32:41,388 --> 00:32:44,978
- What makes you think she'll be there?
- I read it in a book once.

487
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:48,979
Cool. You handle the dragon.
I'll handle the stairs.

488
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:52,108
I'll find those stairs.
I'll whip their butt too.

489
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:54,158
Those stairs won't know
which way they're going.

490
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:00,619
I'm gonna take drastic steps.

491
00:33:00,699 --> 00:33:03,499
Kick it to the kerb. Don't mess with me.
I'm the stair master.

492
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:08,169
I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a
step right here. I'd step all over it.

493
00:33:11,128 --> 00:33:14,679
Well, at least we know where the
princess is, but where's the...

494
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,592
Dragon!

495
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:34,858
Donkey, look out!

496
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:48,499
Got ya!

497
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:27,709
No. Oh, no. No!

498
00:34:27,788 --> 00:34:31,419
Oh, what large teeth you have.

499
00:34:31,498 --> 00:34:33,406
I mean, white, sparkling teeth.
I know you

500
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,338
probably hear this all
the time from your food,

501
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:39,549
but you must bleach, 'cause that is
one dazzling smile you got there.

502
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:42,139
Do I detect a hint
of minty freshness?

503
00:34:42,218 --> 00:34:46,978
And you know what else? You're...
You're a girl dragon!

504
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:51,568
Oh, sure! I mean, of course
you're a girl dragon.

505
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:55,439
You're just reeking
of feminine beauty.

506
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:57,859
What's the matter with you?
You got something in your eye?

507
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:03,368
Man, I'd really love to stay,
but, you know, I'm...

508
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:07,329
I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd
work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings.

509
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:09,329
Shrek!

510
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:13,128
No! Shrek! Shrek!

511
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:15,128
Shrek!

512
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:49,829
- Wake up!
- What?

513
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:51,539
Are you Princess Fiona?

514
00:35:51,628 --> 00:35:56,959
I am, awaiting a knight
so bold as to rescue me.

515
00:35:57,048 --> 00:35:59,048
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

516
00:35:59,128 --> 00:36:01,128
But wait, Sir Knight.

517
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:03,509
This be-ith our first meeting.

518
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,308
Should it not be a wonderful,
romantic moment?

519
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:11,729
- Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
- Hey, wait. What are you doing?

520
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:13,898
You should sweep me
off my feet...

521
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:17,359
out yonder window and down a
rope on to your valiant steed.

522
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:20,239
You've had a lot of time
to plan this, haven't you?

523
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:27,539
But we have to
savour this moment!

524
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,369
You could recite an
epic poem for me.

525
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:32,918
A ballad? A sonnet!

526
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:36,249
- A limerick? Or something!
- I don't think so.

527
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:40,759
Can I at least know the
name of my champion?

528
00:36:41,882 --> 00:36:42,758
Shrek.

529
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:46,559
Sir Shrek.

530
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:51,389
I pray that you take this favour
as a token of my gratitude.

531
00:36:52,518 --> 00:36:54,518
Thanks!

532
00:36:58,528 --> 00:37:00,358
You didn't slay the dragon?

533
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:02,898
It's on my to-do list.
Now come on!

534
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:05,569
But this isn't right!

535
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:07,909
You were meant to charge in,
sword drawn, banner flying.

536
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:10,078
That's what all the
other knights did.

537
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,459
Yeah, right before
they burst into flame.

538
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:15,036
That's not the point.

539
00:37:16,169 --> 00:37:18,629
Wait. Where are you going?
The exit's over there.

540
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:20,759
Well, I have to save my ass.

541
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,049
What kind of knight are you?

542
00:37:24,129 --> 00:37:26,549
One of a kind.

543
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,009
Slowdown. Slowdown, baby, please.

544
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:33,309
I believe it's healthy to get to know
someone over a long period of time.

545
00:37:33,388 --> 00:37:35,978
Just call me old-fashioned.

546
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:39,568
I don't want to rush into
a physical relationship.

547
00:37:39,649 --> 00:37:43,108
I'm not emotionally ready for
a commitment of this...

548
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,489
Magnitude really is the
word I'm looking for.

549
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:49,079
Magnitude... Hey, that is
unwanted physical contact.

550
00:37:49,158 --> 00:37:51,619
Hey, what are you doing?

551
00:37:51,698 --> 00:37:54,959
Okay, okay. Let's just backup a little
and take this one step at a time.

552
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,168
We really should get to know each
other first as friends or pen pals.

553
00:37:59,248 --> 00:38:03,468
I'm on the road a lot,
but I just love receiving cards...

554
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:05,969
I'd really love to stay, but...

555
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:08,639
Don't do that! That's my tail!
That's my personal tail.

556
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:10,417
You're gonna tear it off.
I don't give permission...

557
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:12,138
What are you gonna do
with that?

558
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:16,018
Hey, now. No way. No! No!

559
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:18,859
No, no! No. No, no, no!
No! Oh!

560
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:47,679
- Hi, Princess!
- It talks!

561
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:51,509
Yeah, it's getting him to
shut up that's the trick.

562
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:29,009
Okay, you two,
head for the exit!

563
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:32,678
I'll take care of the dragon.

564
00:39:39,268 --> 00:39:44,688
Run!

565
00:40:29,396 --> 00:40:30,949
You did it!

566
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,908
You rescued me! You're amazing.
You're...

567
00:40:33,988 --> 00:40:37,739
You're wonderful. You're...

568
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:40,119
a little unorthodox I'll admit.

569
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:45,129
But thy deed is great,
and thine heart is pure.

570
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:49,009
I am eternally in your debt.

571
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:53,429
And where would a brave knight
be without his noble steed?

572
00:40:53,509 --> 00:40:55,832
I hope you heard that.
She called me a noble steed.

573
00:40:55,845 --> 00:40:58,178
She think I'm a steed.

574
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:01,428
The battle is won.

575
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:04,018
You may remove your helmet,
good Sir Knight.

576
00:41:04,724 --> 00:41:06,689
- No.
- Why not?

577
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:08,979
I have helmet hair.

578
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:12,279
Please. I would'st look upon
the face of my rescuer.

579
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:14,949
No, no, you wouldn't... 'st.

580
00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:17,488
But how will you kiss me?

581
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:21,328
What? That wasn't in
the job description.

582
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:23,788
Maybe it's a perk.

583
00:41:23,868 --> 00:41:28,299
No, it's destiny. Oh, you
must know how it goes.

584
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:32,168
A princess locked in a tower
and beset by a dragon...

585
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:35,179
is rescued by a brave knight,

586
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,558
and then they share
true love's first kiss.

587
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:40,719
With Shrek? You think...
Wait.

588
00:41:40,808 --> 00:41:43,978
Wait. You think that
Shrek is your true love?

589
00:41:44,058 --> 00:41:46,058
Well, yes.

590
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:52,569
You think Shrek is
your true love!

591
00:41:52,648 --> 00:41:54,569
What is so funny?

592
00:41:54,648 --> 00:41:57,739
Let's just say
I'm not your type, okay?

593
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:01,329
Of course, you are.
You're my rescuer.

594
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:03,869
Now...
Now remove your helmet.

595
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:06,169
Look. I really don't think
this is a good idea.

596
00:42:06,248 --> 00:42:08,248
- Just take off the helmet.
- I'm not going to.

597
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:09,498
- Take it off.
- No!

598
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:11,668
- Now!
- Okay!

599
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:16,258
Easy. As you command,
Your Highness.

600
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:29,729
You... You're an ogre.

601
00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:33,738
Oh, you were expecting
Prince Charming.

602
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:36,319
Well, yes, actually.

603
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,489
Oh, no. This is all wrong.

604
00:42:41,578 --> 00:42:43,868
You're not supposed
to be an ogre.

605
00:42:43,948 --> 00:42:49,209
Princess, I was sent to
rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?

606
00:42:49,288 --> 00:42:51,209
He's the one who
wants to marry you.

607
00:42:51,289 --> 00:42:53,209
Then why didn't he
come rescue me?

608
00:42:53,298 --> 00:42:57,629
Good question. You should ask
him that when we get there.

609
00:42:57,718 --> 00:43:00,759
But I have to be rescued
by my true love,

610
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:03,598
not by some ogre and
his pet.

611
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:05,729
So much for noble steed.

612
00:43:05,809 --> 00:43:08,439
You're not making
my job any easier.

613
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,898
I'm sorry, but your job
is not my problem.

614
00:43:11,979 --> 00:43:17,239
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if
he wants to rescue me properly,

615
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:19,659
I'll be waiting for
him right here.

616
00:43:19,738 --> 00:43:24,788
Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy,
all right? I'm a delivery boy.

617
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:27,119
You wouldn't dare.

618
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,208
- Ya coming, Donkey?
- Put me down!

619
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:31,249
I'm right behind ya.

620
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:34,918
Put me down, or you will
suffer the consequences!

621
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:39,091
This is not dignified!
Put me down!

622
00:43:39,588 --> 00:43:42,468
Okay, so here's
another question.

623
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:45,599
Say there's a woman that digs you, right,
but you don't really like her that way.

624
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,138
How do you let her down real easy
so her feelings aren't hurt,

625
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:50,648
but you don't get burned
to a crisp and eaten?

626
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:53,478
You just tell her she's
not your true love.

627
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:56,279
Everyone knowest what happens
when you find your...

628
00:43:56,358 --> 00:43:58,948
Hey!

629
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:01,318
The sooner we get to
DuLoc the better.

630
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:04,329
You're gonna love it there, Princess.
It's beautiful!

631
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:08,159
And what of my groom-to-be?
Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

632
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:10,368
Let me put it this
way, Princess.

633
00:44:10,459 --> 00:44:15,149
Men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

634
00:44:16,548 --> 00:44:20,628
I don't know. There are those
who think little of him.

635
00:44:22,759 --> 00:44:25,639
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

636
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:30,688
You're just jealous you can never measure
up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

637
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:33,688
Yeah, well, maybe
you're right, Princess.

638
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:37,069
But I'll let you do the measuring
when you see him tomorrow.

639
00:44:37,149 --> 00:44:41,358
Tomorrow?
It'll take that long?

640
00:44:41,448 --> 00:44:46,159
- Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
- No, that'll take longer.

641
00:44:46,238 --> 00:44:50,658
- We can keep going.
- But there's robbers in the woods.

642
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:54,078
Time out, Shrek!
Camping is starting to sound good.

643
00:44:54,168 --> 00:44:58,259
Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything
we're going to see in this forest.

644
00:44:58,339 --> 00:45:00,718
I need to find
somewhere to camp now!

645
00:45:07,598 --> 00:45:11,689
- Hey! Over here.
- Shrek, we can do better than that.

646
00:45:11,769 --> 00:45:14,349
I don't think this is
fit for a princess.

647
00:45:14,438 --> 00:45:17,229
No, no, it's perfect. It just
needs a few homey touches.

648
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:22,239
Homey touches? Like what?

649
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,579
A door? Well, gentlemen,
I bid thee good night.

650
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:29,080
You want me to read you a
bedtime story? I will.

651
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,449
I said good night!

652
00:45:33,918 --> 00:45:35,879
Shrek, what are you doing?

653
00:45:35,959 --> 00:45:38,998
I just... You know...
Oh, come on.

654
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:41,719
I was just kidding.

655
00:45:47,008 --> 00:45:50,598
And that one,
that's Throwback,

656
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:54,099
the only ogre to ever spit
over three wheat fields.

657
00:45:54,189 --> 00:45:57,269
Right. Yeah.

658
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,279
Hey, can you tell my future
from these stars?

659
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:03,948
The stars don't tell the future,
Donkey. They tell stories.

660
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:07,619
Look there's
Bloodnut the Flatulent.

661
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:11,329
- You can guess what he's famous for.
- I know you're making this up.

662
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:14,119
No, look. There he is,

663
00:46:14,209 --> 00:46:17,289
and there's the group of hunters
running away from his stench.

664
00:46:17,378 --> 00:46:19,959
That is nothing but a
bunch of little dots.

665
00:46:20,049 --> 00:46:23,968
Sometimes things are
more than they appear.

666
00:46:26,299 --> 00:46:28,349
Forget it.

667
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:34,939
Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do
when we get our swamp anyway?

668
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:36,808
Our swamp?

669
00:46:36,899 --> 00:46:38,979
You know, when we're through
rescuing the princess.

670
00:46:39,058 --> 00:46:43,818
We? Donkey, there's no we.
There's no our.

671
00:46:43,899 --> 00:46:46,149
There's just me and my swamp.

672
00:46:46,238 --> 00:46:50,489
The first thing I'm gonna do is build
a ten-foot wall around my land.

673
00:46:50,578 --> 00:46:53,079
You cut me deep, Shrek.

674
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:56,499
You cut me real deep just now.

675
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,499
You know what I think?

676
00:46:58,579 --> 00:47:01,709
I think this whole wall thing is
just a way to keep somebody out.

677
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:05,969
- No, do ya think?
- Are you hiding something?

678
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:08,009
Never mind, Donkey.

679
00:47:08,088 --> 00:47:11,508
Oh, this is another one of
those onion things, isn't it?

680
00:47:11,598 --> 00:47:15,179
No, this is one of those drop-it
and leave-it-alone things.

681
00:47:15,268 --> 00:47:19,019
- Why don't you want to talk about it?
- Why do you want to?

682
00:47:19,098 --> 00:47:20,899
- Why are you blocking?
- I'm not blocking.

683
00:47:20,978 --> 00:47:23,229
- Oh, yes, you are.
- Donkey, I'm warning you.

684
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:26,819
- Who you trying to keep out?
- Everyone! Okay?

685
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:30,529
Oh, now we're getting somewhere.

686
00:47:30,618 --> 00:47:33,909
Oh! For the love of Pete!

687
00:47:33,988 --> 00:47:36,408
What's your problem? What you
got against the whole world?

688
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:38,709
I'm not the one with
the problem, okay?

689
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:41,749
It's the world that seems
to have a problem with me.

690
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,708
People take one look at me
and go, aah! Help! Run!

691
00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:49,549
A big, stupid, ugly ogre!

692
00:47:49,629 --> 00:47:53,849
They judge me
before they even know me.

693
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:55,849
That's why I'm better off alone.

694
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:05,979
You know what?

695
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:11,738
When we met, I didn't think you was
just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

696
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:14,738
Yeah, I know.

697
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:18,249
So, are there any
donkeys up there?

698
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:21,709
Well, there's Gabby,

699
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:24,088
the Small and Annoying.

700
00:48:24,169 --> 00:48:29,089
Okay, I see it now. The big shiny
one, right there. That one there?

701
00:48:29,168 --> 00:48:32,338
- That's the moon.
- Oh, okay.

702
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:56,118
Again. Show me again.

703
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:04,668
Mirror, mirror, show her to me.
Show me the princess.

704
00:49:10,964 --> 00:49:13,678
Perfect.

705
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:19,869
Mmm, yeah, you know
I like it like that.

706
00:50:19,949 --> 00:50:24,208
- Come on, baby. I said I like it.
- Donkey, wake up.

707
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:26,829
- Huh? What?
- Wake up.

708
00:50:26,918 --> 00:50:28,879
- What?
- Good morning.

709
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:32,209
How do you like your eggs?

710
00:50:32,299 --> 00:50:36,259
- Good morning, Princess!
- What's all this about?

711
00:50:36,339 --> 00:50:40,309
We kind of got off to a
bad start yesterday.

712
00:50:40,389 --> 00:50:42,389
I wanted to make it up to you.

713
00:50:42,468 --> 00:50:47,019
After all, you did rescue me.

714
00:50:48,142 --> 00:50:50,109
Thanks.

715
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:53,989
Well, eat up. We've got
a big day ahead of us.

716
00:50:58,449 --> 00:51:00,409
Shrek!

717
00:51:00,488 --> 00:51:02,368
What? It's a compliment.

718
00:51:02,449 --> 00:51:05,409
Better out than in,
I always say.

719
00:51:05,498 --> 00:51:09,249
Well, it's no way to behave in
front of a princess.

720
00:51:09,328 --> 00:51:11,959
- Thanks.
- She's as nasty as you are.

721
00:51:12,049 --> 00:51:16,879
You know, you're not
exactly what I expected.

722
00:51:16,968 --> 00:51:22,059
Maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them.

723
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:27,139
La Liberté! Hey!

724
00:51:27,229 --> 00:51:29,148
Princess!

725
00:51:29,228 --> 00:51:31,899
What are you doing?

726
00:51:31,979 --> 00:51:34,899
Be still, Mon Chérie,
for I am your saviour!

727
00:51:34,988 --> 00:51:39,449
And I am rescuing you
from this green...

728
00:51:39,528 --> 00:51:42,079
- Beast.
- Hey!

729
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:44,488
That's my princess!
Go find your own!

730
00:51:44,578 --> 00:51:49,619
Please, monster! Can't you
see I'm a little busy here?

731
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:53,298
Look, pal, I don't know
who you think you are!

732
00:51:53,379 --> 00:51:55,958
Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude.

733
00:51:56,049 --> 00:51:58,128
Please let me
introduce myself.

734
00:51:58,219 --> 00:52:01,088
Oh, Merry Men!

735
00:52:07,269 --> 00:52:09,349
<i>I steal from the rich

747

Man, that was annoying!

748
00:52:49,308 --> 00:52:51,059
Oh, you little...

749
00:53:19,342 --> 00:53:21,379
Shall we?

750
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:25,599
Hold the phone.

751
00:53:27,847 --> 00:53:29,139
Hold on now.

752
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:31,228
- Where did that come from?
- What?

753
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:34,189
That! Back there.
That was amazing!

754
00:53:34,269 --> 00:53:36,189
Where did you learn that?

755
00:53:36,269 --> 00:53:39,399
Well, when one lives alone,

756
00:53:39,478 --> 00:53:42,238
one has to learn these things
in case there's a...

757
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,948
- There's an arrow in your butt!
- What?

758
00:53:45,029 --> 00:53:48,828
- Oh, would you look at that?
- Oh, no. This is all my fault.

759
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:50,411
- I'm so sorry.
- Why? What's wrong?

760
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:52,566
- Shrek's hurt.
- Shrek's hurt.

761
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,248
Shrek's hurt?
Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.

762
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:56,217
Donkey, I'm okay.

763
00:53:56,229 --> 00:53:58,128
You can't do this to me.
I'm too young for you to die.

764
00:53:58,209 --> 00:54:00,339
Keep your legs elevated.
Turn your head and cough.

765
00:54:00,419 --> 00:54:03,428
- Does anyone know the Heimlich?
- Donkey! Calm down.

766
00:54:03,509 --> 00:54:05,812
If you want to help Shrek,
run into the woods

767
00:54:05,824 --> 00:54:08,138
and find me a blue flower
with red thorns.

768
00:54:08,219 --> 00:54:11,809
Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it.
Blue flower, red thorns.

769
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:15,349
Don't die, Shrek. If you see a long
tunnel, stay away from the light!

770
00:54:15,438 --> 00:54:18,609
- Donkey!
- Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

771
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:20,978
- Blue flower, red thorns.
- What are the flowers for?

772
00:54:21,069 --> 00:54:23,278
For getting rid of Donkey.

773
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,739
Now you hold still, and
I'll yank this thing out.

774
00:54:25,818 --> 00:54:28,029
Ow! Hey! Easy
with the yanking.

775
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:30,739
- I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
- No, it's tender.

776
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:32,578
Now, hold on.

777
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:33,692
What you're doing is
the opposite of help.

778
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:34,748
Don't move.

779
00:54:34,828 --> 00:54:37,499
- Look, time out.
- Would you...

780
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:42,048
Okay.
What do you propose we do?

781
00:54:42,128 --> 00:54:43,471
Blue flower, red thorns.

782
00:54:43,485 --> 00:54:44,838
Blue flower, red thorns.

783
00:54:44,929 --> 00:54:47,298
This would be so much easier
if I wasn't colour-blind!

784
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:49,469
Blue flower, red thorns.

785
00:54:49,548 --> 00:54:51,968
Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!

786
00:54:54,521 --> 00:54:55,598
Not good.

787
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:58,229
Okay. Okay, I can nearly
see the head.

788
00:54:58,308 --> 00:55:00,626
It's just about...

789
00:55:05,488 --> 00:55:08,869
Nothing happened.
We were just...

790
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:11,659
Look, if you wanted to be alone,
all you had to do was ask.

791
00:55:11,738 --> 00:55:14,999
Oh, come on! That's the
last thing on my mind.

792
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:18,331
The princess here
was just...

793
00:55:23,378 --> 00:55:24,628
Hey, what's that?

794
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:27,549
That's... Is that blood?

795
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:47,528
<i>My beloved monster and me</i>

796
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:53,289
<i>We go everywhere together</i>

797
00:55:53,368 --> 00:55:58,078
<i>Wearing a raincoat
that has four sleeves</i>

798
00:55:58,169 --> 00:56:02,788
<i>Gets us through
all kinds of weather</i>

799
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:08,129
<i>She will always be
the only thing</i>

800
00:56:08,219 --> 00:56:12,719
<i>That comes between me
and the awful sting</i>

801
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:17,889
<i>That comes from living in a
world that's so damn mean</i>

802
00:56:45,749 --> 00:56:47,709
Hey!

803
00:56:58,099 --> 00:57:00,018
There it is, Princess.

804
00:57:00,099 --> 00:57:02,438
Your future awaits you.

805
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,769
- That's DuLoc?
- Yeah, I know.

806
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:07,529
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's
compensating for something,

807
00:57:07,608 --> 00:57:10,109
which I think means
he has a really...

808
00:57:11,032 --> 00:57:12,108
I...

809
00:57:12,198 --> 00:57:14,618
- I guess we better move on.
- Sure.

810
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:16,788
But, Shrek?

811
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:19,659
I'm...
I'm worried about Donkey.

812
00:57:19,748 --> 00:57:22,118
- What?
- I mean, look at him.

813
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:25,209
- He doesn't look so good.
- What are you talking about? I'm fine.

814
00:57:25,288 --> 00:57:30,299
That's what they always say, and then
next thing you know, you're on your back.

815
00:57:30,379 --> 00:57:32,839
- Dead.
- You know, she's right.

816
00:57:32,928 --> 00:57:35,799
You look awful. Do you
want to sit down?

817
00:57:35,888 --> 00:57:38,598
- I'll make you some tea.
- I didn't want to say nothing,

818
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:41,428
but I got this twinge in my neck, and
when I turn my head like this, look.

819
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:43,439
Ow! See?

820
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:46,118
- Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.
- I'll get the firewood.

821
00:57:46,188 --> 00:57:50,689
Hey, where you going?
Oh, man, I can't feel my toes!

822
00:57:50,778 --> 00:57:53,279
I don't have any toes!

823
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,699
I think I need a hug.

824
00:58:02,621 --> 00:58:05,539
This is good.
This is really good.

825
00:58:07,748 --> 00:58:10,009
- What is this?
- Weedrat.

826
00:58:10,088 --> 00:58:12,219
Rotisserie style.

827
00:58:12,299 --> 00:58:14,798
No kidding.

828
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:16,799
Well, this is delicious.

829
00:58:16,889 --> 00:58:18,969
Well, they're also
great in stews.

830
00:58:19,059 --> 00:58:23,309
Now, I don't mean to brag, but
I make a mean weedrat stew.

831
00:58:27,019 --> 00:58:31,149
I guess I'll be dining a little
differently tomorrow night.

832
00:58:31,228 --> 00:58:36,319
Maybe you can come visit me
in the swamp sometime.

833
00:58:36,408 --> 00:58:38,578
I'll cook all kinds
of stuff for you.

834
00:58:38,658 --> 00:58:42,538
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartar,
you name it.

835
00:58:44,183 --> 00:58:45,749
I'd like that.

836
00:58:52,668 --> 00:58:56,713
<i>See the pyramids along
the Nile</i>

837
00:58:58,678 --> 00:59:02,929
- Princess?
- Yes, Shrek?

838
00:59:03,018 --> 00:59:06,745
I was wondering.

839
00:59:06,939 --> 00:59:09,189
Are you...

840
00:59:09,268 --> 00:59:11,858
<i>You belong to me</i>

841
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:14,738
Are you gonna eat that?

842
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:24,993
Man, isn't this romantic?
Just look at that sunset.

843
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:28,249
Sunset? Oh, no!
I mean, it's late.

844
00:59:28,329 --> 00:59:30,209
- It's very late.
- What?

845
00:59:30,288 --> 00:59:33,209
Wait a minute. I see
what's going on here.

846
00:59:33,298 --> 00:59:36,259
- You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?
- Yes!

847
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:40,348
Yes, that's it. I'm terrified.
You know, I'd better go inside.

848
00:59:40,429 --> 00:59:43,768
Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to
be afraid of the dark too, until...

849
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:46,598
Hey, no, wait. I'm still
afraid of the dark.

850
00:59:47,732 --> 00:59:49,859
Good night.

851
00:59:49,939 --> 00:59:52,979
Good night.

852
00:59:56,189 --> 00:59:58,949
Now I really see
what's going on here.

853
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,949
Oh, what are you
talking about?

854
01:00:01,028 --> 01:00:03,788
I don't even wanna hear it. Look,
I'm an animal, and I got instincts.

855
01:00:03,869 --> 01:00:06,289
I know you two were digging on
each other. I could feel it.

856
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:09,208
You're crazy. I'm just bringing
her back to Farquaad.

857
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:12,628
Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up
and smell the pheromones.

858
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,066
Just go on in and tell her
how you feel.

859
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:19,469
There's nothing to tell. Besides,
even if I did tell her that,

860
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:21,468
well, you know...

861
01:00:21,549 --> 01:00:25,059
and I'm not saying I do
'cause I don't...

862
01:00:25,139 --> 01:00:27,559
She's a princess, and I'm...

863
01:00:27,638 --> 01:00:30,309
An ogre?

864
01:00:30,398 --> 01:00:33,058
Yeah. An ogre.

865
01:00:33,149 --> 01:00:37,188
- Hey, where you going?
- To get more firewood.

866
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:58,129
Princess?

867
01:00:58,219 --> 01:01:00,929
Princess Fiona?

868
01:01:05,179 --> 01:01:08,019
Princess, where are you?

869
01:01:13,268 --> 01:01:15,769
Princess?

870
01:01:18,859 --> 01:01:21,609
It's very spooky in here.
I am not playing no games.

871
01:01:32,141 --> 01:01:34,248
Oh, no! No, help!

872
01:01:34,329 --> 01:01:37,418
- Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

873
01:01:37,499 --> 01:01:40,379
- What did you do with the princess?
- Donkey, I'm the princess.

874
01:01:40,468 --> 01:01:43,219
It's me, in this body.

875
01:01:43,298 --> 01:01:45,849
Oh, my God!
You ate the princess!

876
01:01:45,929 --> 01:01:47,849
- Can you hear me?
- Donkey!

877
01:01:47,929 --> 01:01:50,269
Listen, keep breathing!
I'll get you out of there!

878
01:01:50,349 --> 01:01:52,809
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

879
01:01:52,889 --> 01:01:54,728
- Shrek!
- This is me.

880
01:01:59,858 --> 01:02:02,738
Princess?

881
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:06,319
What happened to you?
You're...

882
01:02:06,409 --> 01:02:08,328
different.

883
01:02:08,409 --> 01:02:10,659
- I'm ugly, okay?
- Well, yeah!

884
01:02:10,748 --> 01:02:13,868
Was it something you ate? 'Cause I
told Shrek those rats was a bad idea.

885
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:16,499
- You are what you eat, I said. Now...
- No.

886
01:02:16,589 --> 01:02:19,919
I've been this way
as long as I can remember.

887
01:02:20,009 --> 01:02:22,469
What do you mean? Look, I have
never seen you like this before.

888
01:02:22,549 --> 01:02:25,719
It only happens when
the sun goes down.

889
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:30,768
By night one way,
by day another.

890
01:02:30,849 --> 01:02:32,888
This shall be the norm...

891
01:02:32,979 --> 01:02:36,099
until you find true
love's first kiss...

892
01:02:36,188 --> 01:02:40,609
and then take
love's true form.

893
01:02:40,689 --> 01:02:44,238
Ah, that's beautiful.
I didn't know you wrote poetry.

894
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:46,239
It's a spell.

895
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:48,908
When I was a little girl,

896
01:02:48,989 --> 01:02:51,659
a witch cast a spell on me.

897
01:02:51,749 --> 01:02:54,289
Every night I become this.

898
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:58,038
This horrible, ugly beast!

899
01:03:00,548 --> 01:03:05,589
I was placed in a tower to await the
day my true love would rescue me.

900
01:03:05,678 --> 01:03:08,259
That's why I have to marry
Lord Farquaad tomorrow...

901
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:11,769
before the sun sets
and he sees me...

902
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:15,978
like this.

903
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:19,309
All right, all right. Calm down.
Look, it's not that bad.

904
01:03:19,398 --> 01:03:23,569
You're not that ugly.
Well, I am not gonna lie. You are ugly.

905
01:03:23,648 --> 01:03:26,659
But you only look like this at night.
Shrek's ugly 24-7.

906
01:03:26,739 --> 01:03:30,118
But, Donkey, I'm a princess,

907
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:33,789
and this is not how a
princess is meant to look.

908
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:37,619
Princess, how about if you
don't marry Farquaad?

909
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,629
I have to.

910
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:42,549
Only my true love's kiss
can break the spell.

911
01:03:42,629 --> 01:03:46,169
But, you know,
you're kind of an ogre,

912
01:03:46,258 --> 01:03:49,679
and Shrek, well,
you got a lot in common.

913
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,258
Shrek?

914
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:55,179
Princess, I...
How's it going, first of all?

915
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:58,059
Good? Good for me too.

916
01:03:58,148 --> 01:04:00,059
I'm okay.

917
01:04:00,148 --> 01:04:05,028
I saw this flower and thought of
you because it's pretty and...

918
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:09,359
well, I don't really like it, but I thought
you might like it 'cause you're pretty.

919
01:04:09,448 --> 01:04:12,659
But I like you anyway.
I'd...

920
01:04:14,829 --> 01:04:18,369
I'm in trouble.
Okay, here we go.

921
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:20,959
I can't just marry
whoever I want.

922
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:23,338
Take a good look
at me, Donkey.

923
01:04:23,419 --> 01:04:25,338
I mean, really,

924
01:04:25,418 --> 01:04:28,089
who could ever love a beast
so hideous and ugly?

925
01:04:28,178 --> 01:04:30,588
Princess and ugly
don't go together.

926
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:33,099
That's why I can't stay
here with Shrek.

927
01:04:33,178 --> 01:04:37,598
My only chance to live happily ever
after is to marry my truelove.

928
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:41,099
Don't you see, Donkey?

929
01:04:41,188 --> 01:04:44,479
That's just how it has to be.

930
01:04:44,569 --> 01:04:47,608
It's the only way
to break the spell.

931
01:04:47,689 --> 01:04:50,449
- You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
- No!

932
01:04:50,529 --> 01:04:53,449
You can't breathe a word.
No one must ever know.

933
01:04:53,529 --> 01:04:55,659
What's the point of being able to
talk if you gotta keep secrets?

934
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:58,869
Promise you won't tell.
Promise!

935
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:02,038
All right, all right. I won't tell him.
But you should.

936
01:05:02,129 --> 01:05:05,129
I just know before this is over, I'm gonna
need a whole lot of serious therapy.

937
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:08,759
Look at my eye twitching.

938
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:35,199
I tell him, I tell him not.

939
01:05:35,658 --> 01:05:39,658
I tell him, I tell him not.

940
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:41,669
I tell him.

941
01:05:41,749 --> 01:05:43,829
Shrek!

942
01:05:43,919 --> 01:05:46,459
Shrek, there's
something I want...

943
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:09,479
Shrek.

944
01:06:10,899 --> 01:06:12,949
- Are you all right?
- Perfect!

945
01:06:13,029 --> 01:06:14,988
Never been better.

946
01:06:15,069 --> 01:06:18,369
I... I don't... There's
something I have to tell you.

947
01:06:18,449 --> 01:06:20,998
You don't have to tell
me anything, Princess.

948
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:23,168
- I heard enough last night.
- You heard what I said?

949
01:06:23,249 --> 01:06:25,168
Every word.

950
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:27,418
I thought you'd understand.

951
01:06:27,499 --> 01:06:29,418
Oh, I understand.

952
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:33,089
Like you said, who could
love a hideous, ugly beast?

953
01:06:33,178 --> 01:06:35,838
But I thought that
wouldn't matter to you.

954
01:06:35,929 --> 01:06:37,679
Yeah? Well, it does.

955
01:06:40,269 --> 01:06:42,478
Ah, right on time.

956
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,439
Princess, I've brought
you a little something.

957
01:06:49,859 --> 01:06:53,529
What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

958
01:06:53,608 --> 01:06:56,239
Who said that?
Couldn't have been a donkey.

959
01:06:57,618 --> 01:07:00,078
Princess Fiona.

960
01:07:00,158 --> 01:07:02,868
As promised. Now hand it over.

961
01:07:02,949 --> 01:07:07,208
Very well, ogre. The deed to your
swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

962
01:07:07,288 --> 01:07:11,839
Take it and go before
I change my mind.

963
01:07:11,919 --> 01:07:14,758
Forgive me, Princess,
for startling you,

964
01:07:14,839 --> 01:07:16,758
but you startled me,

965
01:07:16,839 --> 01:07:20,509
for I have never seen such
a radiant beauty before.

966
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:23,599
I am Lord Farquaad.

967
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:27,559
Lord Farquaad?
Oh, no, no.

968
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:30,609
Forgive me, my Lord, for
I was just saying...

969
01:07:30,689 --> 01:07:36,149
a short farewell.

970
01:07:36,238 --> 01:07:40,869
That is so sweet. You don't have
to waste good manners on the ogre.

971
01:07:40,948 --> 01:07:42,869
It's not like it has feelings.

972
01:07:42,949 --> 01:07:46,919
No, you're right. It doesn't.

973
01:07:46,999 --> 01:07:50,999
Princess Fiona, beautiful,
fair, flawless Fiona.

974
01:07:51,088 --> 01:07:54,088
I ask your hand in marriage.

975
01:07:54,169 --> 01:07:59,218
Will you be the perfect bride
for the perfect groom?

976
01:08:02,508 --> 01:08:07,688
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...

977
01:08:07,769 --> 01:08:10,939
Excellent! I'll start the
plans, for tomorrow we wed!

978
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:12,938
No! I mean...

979
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:15,398
Why wait?

980
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:19,319
Let's get married today
before the sun sets.

981
01:08:19,408 --> 01:08:22,118
Oh, anxious, are we?
You're right.

982
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:26,118
The sooner, the better.
There's so much to do!

983
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:28,538
There's the caterer, the cake,
the band, the guest list.

984
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:31,629
Captain, round up some guests!

985
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:34,418
Fare-thee-well, ogre.

986
01:08:34,499 --> 01:08:37,089
Shrek, what are you doing?
You're letting her get away.

987
01:08:37,169 --> 01:08:38,518
Yeah? So what?

988
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,889
Shrek, there's something
about her you don't know.

989
01:08:39,969 --> 01:08:42,389
Look, I talked to her last night.
She's...

990
01:08:42,469 --> 01:08:46,519
I know you talked to her last night.
You're great pals, aren't ya?

991
01:08:46,599 --> 01:08:50,349
Now, if you two are such good friends,
why don't you follow her home?

992
01:08:50,438 --> 01:08:52,399
Shrek, I wanna go with you.

993
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:55,438
I told you, didn't I? You're
not coming home with me.

994
01:08:55,529 --> 01:08:59,489
I live alone! My swamp!
Me! Nobody else!

995
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,659
Understand? Nobody!

996
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:06,578
Especially useless, pathetic,
annoying, talking donkeys!

997
01:09:06,659 --> 01:09:09,829
- But I thought...
- Yeah. You know what?

998
01:09:09,918 --> 01:09:12,129
You thought wrong!

999
01:09:13,878 --> 01:09:15,799
Shrek.

1000
01:09:21,588 --> 01:09:25,599
<i>I heard there was
a secret chord</i>

1001
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:28,729
<i>That David played and
it pleased the Lord</i>

1002
01:09:28,809 --> 01:09:33,648
<i>But you don't really
care for music, do ya</i>

1003
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:38,739
<i>It goes like this the fourth,
the fifth</i>

1004
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:41,359
<i>The minor fall,
the major lift</i>

1005
01:09:41,449 --> 01:09:48,078
<i>The baffled king
composing hallelujah</i>

1006
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:51,409
<i>Hallelujah.</i>

1007
01:09:51,498 --> 01:09:54,918
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1008
01:09:54,999 --> 01:09:58,918
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1009
01:09:59,009 --> 01:10:03,759
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1010
01:10:05,678 --> 01:10:09,179
<i>Baby, I've been here before</i>

1011
01:10:09,268 --> 01:10:12,389
<i>I know this room,
I've walked this floor</i>

1012
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:17,568
<i>I used to live alone
before I knew you</i>

1013
01:10:19,278 --> 01:10:22,358
<i>I've seen your flag
on the marble arch</i>

1014
01:10:22,449 --> 01:10:25,778
<i>But love is not a
victory march.</i>

1015
01:10:25,869 --> 01:10:30,288
<i>It's a cold and it's
a broken hallelujah</i>

1016
01:10:31,909 --> 01:10:35,039
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1017
01:10:35,128 --> 01:10:38,248
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1018
01:10:38,339 --> 01:10:41,378
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1019
01:10:41,459 --> 01:10:42,139
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1020
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,558
<i>And all I ever
learned from love</i>

1021
01:10:52,639 --> 01:10:55,019
<i>Is how to shoot
at someone</i>

1022
01:10:55,098 --> 01:10:57,688
<i>Who outdrew you</i>

1023
01:10:57,769 --> 01:11:01,489
<i>And it's not a cry
you can hear at night</i>

1024
01:11:01,568 --> 01:11:04,609
<i>It's not somebody
who's seen the light</i>

1025
01:11:04,699 --> 01:11:11,748
<i>It's a cold and it's
a broken hallelujah</i>

1026
01:11:11,829 --> 01:11:14,619
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1027
01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:17,959
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1028
01:11:18,039 --> 01:11:21,298
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1029
01:11:21,379 --> 01:11:22,059
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1030
01:11:36,269 --> 01:11:38,269
Donkey?

1031
01:11:38,358 --> 01:11:40,569
What are you doing?

1032
01:11:40,649 --> 01:11:43,608
I would think, of all people, you would
recognise a wall when you see one.

1033
01:11:43,689 --> 01:11:45,608
Well, yeah.

1034
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:49,069
But the wall's supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.

1035
01:11:49,159 --> 01:11:51,949
It is around your half. See, that's
your half, and this is my half.

1036
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:54,618
Oh! Your half.

1037
01:11:54,699 --> 01:11:57,249
Yes, my half. I helped
rescue the princess.

1038
01:11:57,328 --> 01:11:59,578
I did half the work,
I get half the booty.

1039
01:11:59,669 --> 01:12:02,998
Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.

1040
01:12:03,088 --> 01:12:05,419
- Back off!
- No, you back off.

1041
01:12:05,508 --> 01:12:07,508
- This is my swamp!
- Our swamp.

1042
01:12:07,588 --> 01:12:09,509
- Let go, Donkey!
- You let go.

1043
01:12:09,588 --> 01:12:11,559
- Stubborn jackass!
- Smelly ogre.

1044
01:12:11,638 --> 01:12:13,849
Fine!

1045
01:12:13,928 --> 01:12:15,587
Hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you yet.

1046
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,269
Well, I'm through with you.

1047
01:12:17,348 --> 01:12:20,609
You know, with you,
it's always me, me, me!

1048
01:12:20,689 --> 01:12:23,279
Well, guess what!
Now it's my turn!

1049
01:12:23,358 --> 01:12:25,489
So you just shut up
and pay attention!

1050
01:12:25,569 --> 01:12:27,528
You are mean to me.

1051
01:12:27,608 --> 01:12:30,118
You insult me and you don't
appreciate anything that I do!

1052
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:33,289
You're always pushing me
around or pushing me away.

1053
01:12:33,368 --> 01:12:37,209
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you
so bad, how come you came back?

1054
01:12:37,289 --> 01:12:40,498
Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!

1055
01:12:40,579 --> 01:12:43,799
Oh, yeah.
You're right, Donkey.

1056
01:12:43,879 --> 01:12:48,088
I forgive you for
stabbing me in the back!

1057
01:12:50,264 --> 01:12:53,599
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy,
you're afraid of your own feelings.

1058
01:12:53,678 --> 01:12:54,949
Go away!

1059
01:12:55,034 --> 01:12:57,139
There you are, doing it
again just like you did to Fiona.

1060
01:12:57,229 --> 01:12:59,808
All she ever do was like,
maybe even love you.

1061
01:12:59,899 --> 01:13:04,019
Love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.

1062
01:13:04,108 --> 01:13:06,029
I heard the two of you talking.

1063
01:13:06,108 --> 01:13:08,029
She wasn't talking about you.

1064
01:13:08,108 --> 01:13:10,448
She was talking about
somebody else.

1065
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:15,408
She wasn't talking about me?

1066
01:13:15,489 --> 01:13:17,789
Well, then who was
she talking about?

1067
01:13:17,869 --> 01:13:20,668
No way. I am not saying anything.
You don't wanna listen to me.

1068
01:13:20,669 --> 01:13:22,959
- Right? Right?
- Donkey!

1069
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:25,588
- No!
- Okay, look.

1070
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:27,588
I'm sorry, all right?

1071
01:13:32,469 --> 01:13:36,099
I'm sorry.

1072
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:40,439
I guess I am just a big,
stupid, ugly ogre.

1073
01:13:41,649 --> 01:13:43,608
Can you forgive me?

1074
01:13:45,819 --> 01:13:47,729
Hey, that's what friends
are for, right?

1075
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:50,488
Right. Friends?

1076
01:13:50,568 --> 01:13:52,489
Friends.

1077
01:13:52,568 --> 01:13:55,529
So...

1078
01:13:55,618 --> 01:13:57,868
what did Fiona say about me?

1079
01:13:57,949 --> 01:14:01,079
What are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her?

1080
01:14:01,158 --> 01:14:04,168
The wedding! We'll
never make it in time.

1081
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:07,458
Never fear, for where
there's a will, there's a way,

1082
01:14:07,549 --> 01:14:09,669
and I have a way.

1083
01:14:14,048 --> 01:14:16,509
Donkey?

1084
01:14:16,599 --> 01:14:18,969
I guess it's just
my animal magnetism.

1085
01:14:19,058 --> 01:14:22,228
Aw, come here, you.

1086
01:14:22,308 --> 01:14:23,696
All right, all right.
Don't get all slobbery.

1087
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:25,108
No one likes a kiss ass.

1088
01:14:25,188 --> 01:14:27,728
All right, hop on
and hold on tight.

1089
01:14:27,818 --> 01:14:31,319
I haven't had a chance to
install the seat belts yet.

1090
01:15:02,978 --> 01:15:05,518
People of DuLoc,

1091
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:08,269
we gather here today...

1092
01:15:08,359 --> 01:15:10,398
to bear witness...

1093
01:15:10,478 --> 01:15:12,399
to the union...

1094
01:15:12,489 --> 01:15:14,949
- of our new king...
- Excuse me.

1095
01:15:15,029 --> 01:15:17,698
Could we just skip ahead
to the I do's?

1096
01:15:17,778 --> 01:15:19,699
Go on.

1097
01:15:24,749 --> 01:15:28,379
Go ahead, have some fun. If we need
you, I'll whistle. How about that?

1098
01:15:30,999 --> 01:15:32,919
Shrek, wait, wait!
Wait a minute!

1099
01:15:33,008 --> 01:15:35,679
- You wanna do this right, don't you?
- What are you talking about?

1100
01:15:35,759 --> 01:15:37,679
There's a line you
gotta wait for.

1101
01:15:37,759 --> 01:15:40,258
The preacher's gonna say, speak
now or forever hold your peace.

1102
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:44,099
- That's when you say, I object!
- I don't have time for this!

1103
01:15:44,179 --> 01:15:45,889
Wait. What are you doing?
Listen to me!

1104
01:15:45,979 --> 01:15:47,898
- Look, you love this woman, don't you?
- Yes.

1105
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:49,268
- You wanna hold her?
- Yes.

1106
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:50,839
- Please her?
- Yes!

1107
01:15:50,919 --> 01:15:54,278
Then you got to, got to
try a little tenderness.

1108
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:57,108
- The chicks love that romantic crap!
- All right! Cut it out.

1109
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:00,829
- When does this guy say the line?
- We gotta check it out.

1110
01:16:00,909 --> 01:16:04,079
And so, by the power
vested in me...

1111
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:07,419
- What do you see?
- The whole town's in there.

1112
01:16:07,499 --> 01:16:10,628
- I now pronounce you husband and wife.
- They're at the altar.

1113
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:13,259
- King and queen.
- Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

1114
01:16:13,338 --> 01:16:15,969
Oh, for the love of Pete!

1115
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:19,259
I object!

1116
01:16:19,339 --> 01:16:21,429
Shrek?

1117
01:16:21,509 --> 01:16:23,428
Oh, now what does he want?

1118
01:16:27,018 --> 01:16:30,059
Hi, everyone. Having
a good time, are ya?

1119
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:32,358
I love DuLoc, first of all.

1120
01:16:32,438 --> 01:16:34,939
- Very clean.
- What are you doing here?

1121
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:37,948
Really, it's rude enough being
alive when no one wants you.

1122
01:16:38,028 --> 01:16:41,368
- But showing up uninvited to a wedding...
- Fiona!

1123
01:16:41,449 --> 01:16:44,448
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh, now you wanna talk?

1124
01:16:44,539 --> 01:16:47,498
It's a little late for that,
so if you'll excuse me...

1125
01:16:47,579 --> 01:16:49,959
- But you can't marry him.
- And why not?

1126
01:16:50,038 --> 01:16:53,918
Because... Because he's just
marrying you so he can be king.

1127
01:16:53,999 --> 01:16:56,379
Outrageous! Fiona,
don't listen to him.

1128
01:16:56,458 --> 01:17:00,089
- He's not your true love.
- And what do you know about true love?

1129
01:17:00,179 --> 01:17:02,549
Well, I...

1130
01:17:02,638 --> 01:17:06,019
- I mean...
- Oh, this is precious.

1131
01:17:06,098 --> 01:17:10,768
The ogre has fallen
in love with the princess!

1132
01:17:10,849 --> 01:17:13,108
Oh, good Lord.

1133
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:15,108
An ogre and a princess!

1134
01:17:20,739 --> 01:17:23,238
Shrek, is this true?

1135
01:17:24,658 --> 01:17:27,198
Who cares? It's preposterous!

1136
01:17:27,289 --> 01:17:30,919
Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss
away from our happily ever after.

1137
01:17:30,999 --> 01:17:32,984
Now kiss me!

1138
01:17:37,668 --> 01:17:41,009
By night one way,
by day another.

1139
01:17:42,929 --> 01:17:45,678
I wanted to show you before.

1140
01:18:08,249 --> 01:18:10,789
Well...

1141
01:18:10,869 --> 01:18:12,869
that explains a lot.

1142
01:18:14,001 --> 01:18:16,629
It's disgusting!

1143
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:18,758
Guards! Guards!

1144
01:18:18,839 --> 01:18:22,008
I order you to get that out
of my sight now! Get them!

1145
01:18:22,089 --> 01:18:24,888
- Get them both!
- No, no!

1146
01:18:24,969 --> 01:18:26,832
This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
This marriage is binding,

1147
01:18:26,844 --> 01:18:28,718
and that makes me king!

1148
01:18:28,809 --> 01:18:31,099
- See? See?
- No, let go of me! Shrek!

1149
01:18:31,179 --> 01:18:32,889
- No!
- Don't just stand there, you morons.

1150
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:35,519
Get out of my way!
Fiona!

1151
01:18:40,778 --> 01:18:43,779
I'll make you regret the day we met.
I'll see you drawn and quartered!

1152
01:18:43,858 --> 01:18:46,779
- You'll beg for death to save you!
- No! Shrek!

1153
01:18:46,869 --> 01:18:50,369
- And as for you, my wife...
- Fiona!

1154
01:18:50,448 --> 01:18:53,119
I'll have you locked back in that
tower for the rest of your days!

1155
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:55,038
I am king!

1156
01:18:55,129 --> 01:18:58,918
I will have order! I will have
perfection! I will have...

1157
01:19:04,381 --> 01:19:06,089
All right. Nobody move.

1158
01:19:06,179 --> 01:19:08,259
I got a dragon here, and
I'm not afraid to use it.

1159
01:19:08,348 --> 01:19:10,969
I'm a donkey on the edge!

1160
01:19:15,648 --> 01:19:18,059
Celebrity marriages.
They never last, do they?

1161
01:19:20,229 --> 01:19:22,068
Go ahead, Shrek.

1162
01:19:24,492 --> 01:19:25,739
Fiona?

1163
01:19:26,869 --> 01:19:29,078
Yes, Shrek?

1164
01:19:29,159 --> 01:19:33,209
I... I love you.

1165
01:19:33,289 --> 01:19:35,539
Really?

1166
01:19:36,629 --> 01:19:39,629
Really, really.

1167
01:19:39,709 --> 01:19:41,629
I love you too.

1168
01:19:50,678 --> 01:19:53,928
Until you find truelove's
first kiss...

1169
01:19:54,019 --> 01:19:57,309
and then take love's
true form.

1170
01:20:20,878 --> 01:20:23,799
Take love's true form.
Take love's true form.

1171
01:20:29,968 --> 01:20:32,469
Fiona?

1172
01:20:34,979 --> 01:20:37,558
Fiona.

1173
01:20:37,639 --> 01:20:40,189
Are you all right?

1174
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:42,189
Well, yes.

1175
01:20:42,268 --> 01:20:45,529
But I don't understand.

1176
01:20:45,609 --> 01:20:47,738
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

1177
01:20:50,448 --> 01:20:52,698
But you are beautiful.

1178
01:20:55,249 --> 01:20:57,709
I was hoping this would
be a happy ending.

1179
01:21:01,499 --> 01:21:05,919
<i>I thought love was only
true in fairy tales</i>

1180
01:21:07,549 --> 01:21:11,259
<i>Meant for someone
else but not for me</i>

1181
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:16,639
<i>Love was out to get me</i>

1182
01:21:16,729 --> 01:21:19,519
<i>That's the way it seemed</i>

1183
01:21:19,598 --> 01:21:24,068
<i>Disappointment haunted
all my dreams</i>

1184
01:21:24,149 --> 01:21:27,438
<i>And then I saw her face</i>

1185
01:21:27,529 --> 01:21:30,318
<i>Now I'm a believer</i>

1186
01:21:30,409 --> 01:21:32,949
<i>And not a trace</i>

1187
01:21:33,028 --> 01:21:35,788
<i>Of doubt in my mind</i>

1188
01:21:35,869 --> 01:21:39,606
<i>I'm in love</i>

1189
01:21:39,999 --> 01:21:42,459
<i>I'm a believer,
I couldn't leave her</i>

1190
01:21:42,539 --> 01:21:44,748
<i>If I tried</i>

1191
01:21:44,839 --> 01:21:48,879
God bless us, every one.

1192
01:21:48,968 --> 01:21:52,091
<i>Come on, y'all!
Then I saw her face!</i>

1193
01:21:52,589 --> 01:21:55,719
<i>Now I'm a believer!
Listen!</i>

1194
01:21:55,808 --> 01:21:58,599
<i>Not a trace</i>

1195
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:01,479
<i>Of doubt in my mind</i>

1196
01:22:01,559 --> 01:22:03,359
<i>I'm in love</i>

1197
01:22:04,899 --> 01:22:09,149
<i>I'm a believer I couldn't
leave her if I tried</i>

1198
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:14,778
<i>Then I saw her face</i>

1199
01:22:14,869 --> 01:22:17,828
<i>Now I'm a believer!
Hey!</i>

1200
01:22:17,909 --> 01:22:19,724
<i>Not a trace</i>

1201
01:22:20,789 --> 01:22:24,039
<i>Of doubt in my mind!
One more time!</i>

1202
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:28,668
<i>I'm in love
I'm a believer</i>

1203
01:22:28,759 --> 01:22:30,589
<i>Come on!</i>

1204
01:22:30,668 --> 01:22:32,589
<i>I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe</i>

1205
01:22:32,679 --> 01:22:35,349
<i>I believe, I believe I believe,
I believe, I believe, hey</i>

1206
01:22:35,428 --> 01:22:38,009
<i>Y'all sing it with me!
I...</i>

1207
01:22:38,099 --> 01:22:39,769
<i>Believe</i>

1208
01:22:39,848 --> 01:22:42,808
<i>I believe!
People in the back!</i>

1209
01:22:42,889 --> 01:22:45,808
<i>I believe!
I'm a believer!</i>

1210
01:22:45,899 --> 01:22:48,858
<i>I believe</i>

1211
01:22:48,939 --> 01:22:51,819
<i>I believe</i>

1212
01:22:51,899 --> 01:22:56,319
<i>I believe</i>

1213
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:00,477
Oh, that's funny.

1214
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:03,709
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
