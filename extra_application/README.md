# Extra application

Often in Sci-Fi films the scene description has to be more precise 
to explain a whole new world. 

When these scene descriptions are counted it can be possible to determine if the movie 
is a Sci-Fi movie, only with the count of the scene descriptions.

Of course not all Sci-Fi movies have a generally higher scene description count.
