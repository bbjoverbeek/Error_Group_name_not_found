Often in Sci-Fi films a whole new world needs to be put into words. 
This means the scene description needs a lot of lines. This is in many cases more than 
the scene description of any other genre film.  

When the scene descriptions are counted in the program, can be possible to determine if the movie 
is a Sci-Fi movie, only with the count of the scene descriptions.

Of course not all Sci-Fi movies have a generally higher scene description count.

Research question? 
- what is the chance the movie is a Sci-Fi movie?
