1
00:00:52,346 --> 00:00:55,099
Come on, come on.
She's been under too long.

2
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,170
Come on.

3
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:29,341
The name, pal. Give us the name.

4
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:55,659
<i>Za druziye.</i>

5
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,015
Get rid of that scum.

6
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:27,691
Hold her still.

7
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:32,279
Come on.

8
00:02:57,429 --> 00:02:58,889
Did we get it?

9
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:00,975
We got it.

10
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:58,699
Would you like to watch
a movie, Mr. Rosen?

11
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:00,284
No, thank you.

12
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:08,626
Would you like to watch
a movie, Mr. Phelps?

13
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,669
No, I prefer the theater.

14
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:13,464
Would you consider
the cinema of the Ukraine?

15
00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:17,426
Perhaps you'll choose one for me.

16
00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:23,265
Thank you.

17
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:50,209
<i>Good morning, Mr. Phelps.</i>

18
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:53,128
<i>The man you're looking at
is Alexander Golitsyn...</i>

19
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:55,631
<i>an attaché at our embassy in Prague.</i>

20
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:57,508
<i>He is also a traitor.</i>

21
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:01,262
<i>He has stolen one half
of a CIA NOC list...</i>

22
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:05,391
<i>a record of all our deep-cover agents
working in Eastern Europe.</i>

23
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:09,311
<i>For security reasons,
the NOC list is divided in two.</i>

24
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,691
<i>The portion that Golitsyn already has
contains code names...</i>

25
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:15,860
<i>but this half is useless
without its mate...</i>

26
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:18,404
<i>which matches the code names
with their true names.</i>

27
00:05:19,238 --> 00:05:23,117
<i>It is this half which Golitsyn plans
to steal from the embassy...</i>

28
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:25,619
<i>during a reception tomorrow night.</i>

29
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:28,247
<i>Your mission, Jim,
should you choose to accept it...</i>

30
00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:31,375
<i>is to obtain photographic proof
of the theft...</i>

31
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,421
<i>shadow Golitsyn to his buyer,
and apprehend them both.</i>

32
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:39,884
<i>I've already dispatched a team,
selected from your usual group.</i>

33
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,261
<i>Sarah Davies is already undercover.</i>

34
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:45,389
<i>Jack Harmon can hack
into any security system.</i>

35
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:47,766
<i>Hannah Williams
will handle surveillance.</i>

36
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:50,519
<i>Your wife, Claire, will cover transport...</i>

37
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:53,856
<i>and Ethan Hunt will be
your point man, as usual.</i>

38
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:56,984
<i>He is now in Kiev
and will rendezvous in Prague...</i>

39
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:58,986
<i>at a safe house of your choosing.</i>

40
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:02,156
<i>As always, should you or any member
of your IM Force...</i>

41
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:04,200
<i>be caught or killed...</i>

42
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:07,745
<i>the Secretary will disavow
all knowledge of your actions.</i>

43
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,873
<i>This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds.</i>

44
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:12,500
<i>Good luck, Jim.</i>

45
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:37,191
A very straightforward objective.

46
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:40,444
We photograph Golitsyn stealing
the NOC list...

47
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:42,530
follow him to his buyer...

48
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:44,698
apprehend both of them.

49
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:46,617
Now here's the plot.

50
00:06:47,326 --> 00:06:50,996
Ethan, you're going into the embassy
in character, during a party...

51
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,290
hide in plain sight,
highest possible profile.

52
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,002
- You game?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

53
00:06:58,003 --> 00:07:00,464
Sarah, you're at the party already...

54
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,633
as the embassy's
Washington visitor liaison.

55
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,511
Make contact with Ethan.
You'll run the game together.

56
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:07,137
I haven't a thing to wear.

57
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:11,267
Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

58
00:07:13,227 --> 00:07:14,687
You'll mark Golitsyn,
hand him off to Hannah.

59
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:16,981
Hannah, you'll have him
for the duration of the interior.

60
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:20,234
- Find yourself a perch and stay on him.
- No problem.

61
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,694
- Jack?
- Yeah?

62
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:25,531
Fingerprint security, there's access
through the elevator shaft here.

63
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:27,867
So I guess I'm not wearing my tux.

64
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:29,535
Open, close, get out.

65
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,662
Zero residual presence.

66
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,125
Claire, you're cover outside
in the vehicle.

67
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,878
Hannah will join you as Golitsyn
goes exterior...

68
00:07:39,003 --> 00:07:41,630
- you two stay on him from there.
- Okay.

69
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:43,215
Anything goes wrong, I call abort.

70
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:45,676
Everybody walk away immediately.

71
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:50,181
Regroup here at 4:00 a. m. That's 0400.

72
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:52,266
Any questions?

73
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:54,935
Yeah.

74
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:57,813
Can we get
a cappuccino machine in here?

75
00:07:57,897 --> 00:07:59,356
'Cause I don't know what you call this.

76
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:01,734
I call it cruel and unusual.

77
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:04,069
- I made that coffee.
- Exactly.

78
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:06,822
Is it possible it's even worse than
that sludge you made...

79
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:08,532
- in that barn in Kiev?
- Thank you.

80
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:10,451
Take it easy on my wife's coffee,
will you?

81
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:14,038
- We missed you in Kiev, Jim.
- Missed you, too, Ethan.

82
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,665
Were you off on one of your
cushy recruiting assignments again?

83
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:18,459
Where'd they put you up this time?
The Plaza?

84
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:20,920
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

85
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,547
What a shame.

86
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:26,300
- 24-hour room service.
- Chauffeured cars.

87
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:27,843
Fat expense account.

88
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:30,429
- Now he's getting soft in his old age.
- Yeah, he is. Look at him.

89
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,389
Okay, listen.

90
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,975
If that list gets out into the open...

91
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:38,103
the names of our agents
in every country in Eastern Europe...

92
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:40,189
will be up for grabs
to the highest bidders.

93
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:43,901
Third world terrorists, arms dealers,
drug lords...

94
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:47,154
any and everybody who'd love
to get rid of long-term coverts like us.

95
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:51,575
If they're exposed, they'll be executed.

96
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:56,705
So I'll run the whole show
from the crow's nest here.

97
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,500
Everyone knows their roles.
Let's punch out the details.

98
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:02,169
There's a camera built
right into the bridge.

99
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,589
Whatever you see, it sees,
and then it transmits it back here.

100
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:07,424
See?

101
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,635
Can you hear me?

102
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:12,263
- Of course I can hear you.
- No, in your...

103
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:14,181
- You need an earpiece.
- Oh.

104
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:19,770
You have lovely eyes.

105
00:09:19,854 --> 00:09:22,064
- Can you hear me now?
- Loud and clear.

106
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:24,400
If he has a car waiting, and he rolls...

107
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,027
you stay with him no matter what.

108
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:28,612
You should take the afternoon...

109
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:30,447
drive the streets
around this little quarter.

110
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:32,241
They're confusing as hell.

111
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:34,577
What do you think
I've been doing all morning?

112
00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:37,830
- We're using Waltzer?
- He's our guy.

113
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:41,041
Isn't he chairing
the armed services hearing?

114
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,462
Not this week.
This week, he's fly-fishing...

115
00:09:45,713 --> 00:09:47,840
at the Oughterard Slough
in County Kildare...

116
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:50,384
- with one of our best Irish guides.
- Yep.

117
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:52,636
And he won't be back anytime soon.

118
00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:55,222
<i>...irrelevant at best...</i>

119
00:09:55,347 --> 00:09:57,725
<i>or unconstitutional at worst.</i>

120
00:09:57,892 --> 00:09:59,393
<i>With all due respect, Senator...</i>

121
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:02,396
<i>it sounds as if you want
to lead the kind of charge...</i>

122
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:05,691
<i>that Senator Frank Church
led in the 1970s...</i>

123
00:10:05,816 --> 00:10:09,153
<i>and in the process destroy
the intelligence capability...</i>

124
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:10,237
<i>- of this country.
- No, John.</i>

125
00:10:10,362 --> 00:10:12,489
<i>I want to know who these people are...</i>

126
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:15,201
<i>and how they're spending
our taxpayers' money.</i>

127
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:18,704
<i>We were living in a democracy
the last time I checked.</i>

128
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:21,373
Stick of gum, right?

129
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,626
- No?
- No.

130
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:25,836
Red light, green light.

131
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,173
You come up against a lock you
can't pick, you mash them together...

132
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:32,968
<i>hasta lasagna, don't get any on ya.</i>

133
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:35,221
You'll have about five seconds.

134
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:41,227
Just don't chew it.

135
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,266
Ethan, Jack's inside.

136
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:21,976
Let's go.

137
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:28,232
<i>How do you do, Senator?</i>

138
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:29,859
<i>I'm Rand Housman,
the ambassador's aide.</i>

139
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:31,569
<i>- Hello, Mr. Housman.
- How was the opera?</i>

140
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:34,905
It was boring.

141
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:37,616
Let me see if I can steer you
through this reception line.

142
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:50,129
<i>- How do you do, Senator?
- His wife, Mrs. Reid.</i>

143
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:52,047
Windows open by 2300.

144
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:54,592
- Petr Brandl, the mayor of Prague.
- How do you do, sir?

145
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:56,260
And Mrs. Brandl.

146
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:00,681
I bet you don't remember me, do you?

147
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:03,142
Why, of course I do.
How are you, Miss Norman?

148
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:05,561
He's in pocket, on the stairway.

149
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:12,943
Mr. Golitsyn, nice to see you.

150
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:15,988
Hannah...

151
00:12:19,783 --> 00:12:20,784
<i>pull the shade.</i>

152
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:33,756
<i>Sarah, mark the package
and go to tunnel.</i>

153
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:42,223
Your advance team mentioned
that you'd like a tour of the facilities...

154
00:12:42,348 --> 00:12:44,475
so I've gone ahead and set one up.
Excuse me.

155
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,809
This way. Thank you.

156
00:12:57,738 --> 00:12:59,114
Oh, great.

157
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:01,825
...which leads to the denied area...

158
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:05,204
which is the only limited-access area
in the whole facility.

159
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:31,564
Governor's in position now.

160
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:43,993
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- I'm sorry.

161
00:13:44,076 --> 00:13:47,538
As you can see, there's a Marine guard
and video surveillance...

162
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:49,999
and this place is like...
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

163
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:51,876
I know it's in here somewhere.

164
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,920
Now, Sergeant, why are you not
in your uniform this evening?

165
00:13:56,505 --> 00:13:59,758
<i>We've been ordered
to wear civilian clothes this evening, sir.</i>

166
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:03,470
Be right back.

167
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,100
Tell me, Senator, do you not have
someone on your staff named Jack?

168
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:11,854
<i>Jack? Well, I think we did have a Jack.</i>

169
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:15,524
An unreliable fellow,
as I recall, constantly late...

170
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:17,401
<i>behind in his work.</i>

171
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,407
<i>We were forced to tie him behind
one of my best stallions...</i>

172
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,617
and drag him around...

173
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:26,577
<i>my barn for a few days.</i>

174
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,746
Relax your crap, Foghorn.
I'm working on it.

175
00:14:42,426 --> 00:14:43,761
Sorry, sir.

176
00:14:44,428 --> 00:14:45,846
- Thank you.
- Have a nice evening.

177
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:46,931
Thank you.

178
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,570
That date with Sarah is definitely off.

179
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:32,059
Higher.

180
00:15:37,565 --> 00:15:39,859
He's heading to the denied area.

181
00:15:42,528 --> 00:15:43,654
<i>Get moving, Ethan.</i>

182
00:15:43,863 --> 00:15:44,905
He's rolling to you.

183
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:56,876
Jack.

184
00:15:59,545 --> 00:16:00,713
Jack, we're in position here.

185
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:04,550
<i>- Jack.
- I didn't touch it.</i>

186
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:09,180
What about my coat?
I'm going to freeze.

187
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:10,514
Jack, open the doors.

188
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:22,860
He's in the box, Ethan. He's in the box.

189
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:24,737
<i>Okay.</i>

190
00:16:24,862 --> 00:16:26,864
We're taking Golitsyn's exit.
Open these doors.

191
00:16:26,989 --> 00:16:28,324
I don't have it.

192
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,119
I'm opening the doors. Go under.

193
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,873
Go.

194
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:17,748
- He's got it.
- All right.

195
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:21,961
<i>- Saved your ass again, Jack.
- Give me a break, pops.</i>

196
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:23,629
Such a nice ass.

197
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:25,673
And a lonely ass.

198
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,301
- Transport in five minutes.
- Yes, indeed.

199
00:18:12,553 --> 00:18:15,598
Jack, we're in position.
Open the doors and let the package roll.

200
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:17,850
Roger that. Opening doors now.

201
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,644
Stairway, you're wrapped.

202
00:18:20,728 --> 00:18:22,313
<i>Go to transport.</i>

203
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,320
Hey.

204
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:34,408
- Jack, what are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

205
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:42,333
I don't have control, Jack.

206
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,377
- Then I got a problem.
- Cut the power.

207
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:50,257
- Cut the power, Jack.
- Come on, Jack.

208
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:52,551
Cut the power.

209
00:18:52,676 --> 00:18:53,761
<i>Jack?</i>

210
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,055
Jack?

211
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:03,604
Jack?

212
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:06,815
Jack?

213
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:09,944
Jack?

214
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:12,905
<i>Jack, do you copy?</i>

215
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:15,491
<i>- Jack?
- Man down, Ethan.</i>

216
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,201
<i>Man down.</i>

217
00:19:36,804 --> 00:19:38,806
<i>Ethan, stay where you are.</i>

218
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,267
I'm coming to you.

219
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,992
The package is out in the open.

220
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:03,622
Jim...

221
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:05,916
<i>he's in the open.</i>

222
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,042
En route.

223
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:28,230
Jim, he's in the open.

224
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,443
Jim, the package is in the open.

225
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:39,783
- I've got a shadow.
- Can you lose him?

226
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:41,744
No. Abort.

227
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:43,496
Ethan, he's out of pocket.

228
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:49,960
I can't do that.

229
00:20:50,044 --> 00:20:52,963
We're being ambushed, Ethan. Abort.
That's an order.

230
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:55,508
Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.

231
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:57,801
<i>No, damn it! No! I said abort!</i>

232
00:21:08,437 --> 00:21:10,648
Sarah, eye on the package.
Jim, I'm coming to you.

233
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:12,608
Jim gave an abort.
We should walk away.

234
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:16,445
No. We are going to recover that disk.
You understand me?

235
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:18,656
Now, go.

236
00:21:51,105 --> 00:21:52,481
Where are you?

237
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:54,400
About 200 yards from the bridge.

238
00:21:54,483 --> 00:21:55,860
<i>They're covering this frequency.</i>

239
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:57,820
Cut all radio communication.

240
00:21:57,903 --> 00:22:00,614
<i>Repeat. Cut all radio communication.</i>

241
00:22:26,098 --> 00:22:27,224
<i>Ethan!</i>

242
00:22:33,647 --> 00:22:34,857
<i>Ethan...</i>

243
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:01,926
Sarah, abort.

244
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,094
Repeat, abort.

245
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:08,724
Abort!

246
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:10,267
Do you read me?

247
00:23:14,772 --> 00:23:16,607
Sarah? God!

248
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:50,391
Claire. Oh, my God.

249
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,476
My God.

250
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:43,068
Oh, no. Sarah.

251
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:39,625
My God.

252
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,086
<i>Satcom seven.</i>

253
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:45,297
<i>- Central Europe, unsecured.
- Designator?</i>

254
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:48,884
<i>- Bravo-echo-one-one.
- Switching.</i>

255
00:25:51,011 --> 00:25:53,722
<i>- This is Kittridge.
- Go secure.</i>

256
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:55,724
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

257
00:25:57,184 --> 00:25:59,812
This is Ethan Hunt. They're dead.

258
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,190
<i>What? Who's dead?</i>

259
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:05,985
<i>- My team. My team is dead!
- Jesus.</i>

260
00:26:06,485 --> 00:26:08,070
Golitsyn's gone.

261
00:26:08,153 --> 00:26:09,655
They knew we were coming, man.

262
00:26:09,738 --> 00:26:12,491
They knew we were coming,
and the disk is gone.

263
00:26:12,575 --> 00:26:13,951
<i>Are you intact?</i>

264
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:17,663
The disk is gone, did you...
Do you read me? The list is in the open!

265
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:19,081
<i>Listen, I read you.</i>

266
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:22,376
<i>Let's just bring you in safely
and then we'll worry about that, okay?</i>

267
00:26:23,335 --> 00:26:24,920
<i>Were you followed?</i>

268
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:30,676
<i>- I don't think so. I don't think so.
- Don't think. Be sure.</i>

269
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,304
<i>- Are you clean?
- Yes.</i>

270
00:26:34,638 --> 00:26:38,017
<i>Okay. Location green, one hour.
I'll be there myself.</i>

271
00:26:39,602 --> 00:26:41,687
<i>- You're in Prague?
- One hour.</i>

272
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:39,119
I am...

273
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:43,749
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

274
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:48,504
I know how much Jim,
in particular, meant to you, Ethan...

275
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:51,298
personally as well as professionally.

276
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:53,634
Yeah.

277
00:27:58,597 --> 00:28:01,684
Here's a passport, visa. Usual drill.

278
00:28:03,102 --> 00:28:05,938
We'll work the exfiltration
through Canada, debrief you at Langley.

279
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,190
Throw the Prague police a bone or two.

280
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:10,442
You know, toss them a few suspects.

281
00:28:14,947 --> 00:28:15,948
You follow me?

282
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:19,410
Yeah, I follow.

283
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:23,956
I think we've lost enough agents
for one night.

284
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:27,793
You mean, I've lost enough agents
for one night.

285
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:32,047
You seem hell-bent
on blaming yourself, Ethan.

286
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:35,092
Who else is left?

287
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:39,805
Yeah. I see your point.

288
00:28:45,644 --> 00:28:46,770
Why was there another team?

289
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:49,064
What?

290
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,485
Of IMF agents at the embassy tonight.

291
00:28:55,654 --> 00:28:56,864
I don't quite follow you.

292
00:29:00,868 --> 00:29:02,912
Well, see if you can follow me
around the room.

293
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:06,665
The drunk Russians
on the embankment at 7:00 and 8:00...

294
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:13,005
the couple waltzing around me
at the embassy at 9:00 and 11:00...

295
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,883
the waiter standing behind Hannah
at the top of the stairs.

296
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:17,510
Bow tie, 12:00.

297
00:29:18,385 --> 00:29:19,803
The other IMF team.

298
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,766
You're worried about me. Why?

299
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:28,479
Well, for a little over two years...

300
00:29:28,604 --> 00:29:32,358
we've been spotting serious blowback
in IMF operations.

301
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:34,026
We have a penetration.

302
00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:37,363
The other day, we decoded a message
on the internet...

303
00:29:37,446 --> 00:29:39,740
from a Czech we know as Max.

304
00:29:40,032 --> 00:29:42,368
- The arms dealer.
- That's right.

305
00:29:43,536 --> 00:29:46,705
Max, it seems, has two unique gifts...

306
00:29:46,831 --> 00:29:51,001
a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.

307
00:29:52,086 --> 00:29:54,421
This time, he'd gotten to
someone on the inside.

308
00:29:55,339 --> 00:29:58,717
He'd gotten himself
in a position to buy our NOC list.

309
00:29:58,968 --> 00:30:01,345
An operation he referred to as job 314...

310
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:04,056
the job he thought
Golitsyn was doing tonight.

311
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:09,186
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.

312
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:14,233
That's correct.
The actual list is secure at Langley.

313
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:16,485
Golitsyn was a lightning rod.
He was one of ours.

314
00:30:19,446 --> 00:30:23,576
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

315
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:31,750
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

316
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:33,419
Yeah.

317
00:30:35,963 --> 00:30:38,257
The mole's deep inside...

318
00:30:40,551 --> 00:30:42,303
and like you said...

319
00:30:46,223 --> 00:30:47,641
you survived.

320
00:30:50,394 --> 00:30:52,521
I want to show you something, Ethan.

321
00:30:55,024 --> 00:30:56,650
Since your father's death...

322
00:30:56,775 --> 00:30:59,862
your family's farm has been
in receivership...

323
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:04,283
and now, suddenly, they're flush
with over 120 grand in the bank.

324
00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:05,701
Your father's illness...

325
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:07,953
was supposed to have wiped out
that bank account.

326
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:11,499
Dying slowly in America, after all...

327
00:31:11,624 --> 00:31:14,084
can be a very expensive proposition.

328
00:31:16,086 --> 00:31:17,171
So...

329
00:31:18,005 --> 00:31:22,343
why don't we quietly get out of here
and onto a plane?

330
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:27,431
I can understand you're very upset.

331
00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:30,100
Kittridge, you've
never seen me very upset.

332
00:31:30,184 --> 00:31:32,937
All right, Hunt. Enough is enough.

333
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,231
You have bribed, cajoled, and killed...

334
00:31:35,356 --> 00:31:37,483
and you have done it using loyalties
on the inside.

335
00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:39,610
You want to shake hands with the devil,
that's fine with me.

336
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:41,695
I just want to make sure
that you do it in hell.

337
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,903
Money, money.
Where's the damn money?

338
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:15,349
<i>The other day, we decoded a message
on the internet...</i>

339
00:34:15,474 --> 00:34:17,643
<i>from a Czech we know as Max.</i>

340
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,981
<i>He'd gotten himself
in a position to buy our NOC list.</i>

341
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:24,817
<i>An operation he referred to as job 314.</i>

342
00:34:31,365 --> 00:34:33,033
Job 314.

343
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:43,878
Job 314. I can't...

344
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:01,937
Job...

345
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,541
Job 3:14?

346
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,627
Job 3:14.

347
00:35:46,607 --> 00:35:48,442
You son of a bitch.

348
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,001
Ethan...

349
00:37:31,212 --> 00:37:32,922
what are you doing?

350
00:37:34,715 --> 00:37:38,177
I needed you, Ethan.
I needed you on the bridge...

351
00:37:40,554 --> 00:37:42,431
but you weren't there.

352
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:47,186
<i>Ethan.</i>

353
00:37:49,063 --> 00:37:50,314
Ethan.

354
00:37:51,899 --> 00:37:53,192
Ethan?

355
00:37:58,405 --> 00:37:59,740
Don't move.

356
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:02,701
Ethan.

357
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:06,205
Ethan, it's okay. Just calm down.

358
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:08,207
It's Claire.

359
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:11,293
- It's okay.
- You were in the car.

360
00:38:11,877 --> 00:38:13,629
No, I wasn't.

361
00:38:15,756 --> 00:38:17,174
I heard on the radio...

362
00:38:17,258 --> 00:38:20,427
Shut up, I saw you. You were in the car.

363
00:38:21,095 --> 00:38:23,097
No, I got out of the car.

364
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:26,392
I ran to the bridge.
He said someone was just...

365
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:29,228
Don't give me that. I was on the bridge.

366
00:38:29,353 --> 00:38:32,481
- There was nobody on the bridge.
- What happened to Jim?

367
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:34,733
Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead!

368
00:38:34,942 --> 00:38:37,236
They're dead! They're all dead!

369
00:38:45,244 --> 00:38:48,164
- Who sent you for me?
- Jim's dead?

370
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:50,583
- Who sent you here?
- Jim...

371
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:53,002
Take off your coat.

372
00:39:01,802 --> 00:39:03,929
- Where were you, huh?
- I...

373
00:39:06,307 --> 00:39:07,808
Where were you?

374
00:39:08,976 --> 00:39:12,938
I walked away. He said abort.
I just walked away.

375
00:39:13,355 --> 00:39:15,941
That was four hours ago.
Who sent you?

376
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:18,152
- Did they send you for me?
- Who's "they"?

377
00:39:18,277 --> 00:39:19,904
Did they send you?

378
00:39:19,987 --> 00:39:21,739
Look, who sent you? Who sent you?

379
00:39:21,822 --> 00:39:24,158
No one sent me. No one sent me.

380
00:39:24,283 --> 00:39:26,327
We were supposed to be
back here at 4:00.

381
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:31,165
4:00 if we abort.
We don't return here until 4:00, 0400...

382
00:39:31,332 --> 00:39:34,293
4:00 a. m. 4:00, Ethan, 4:00.

383
00:39:35,002 --> 00:39:36,337
If we abort.

384
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:39,590
4:00 a. m.

385
00:39:58,984 --> 00:39:59,985
I've been disavowed.

386
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:09,453
They actually think I killed Jim
and everyone else.

387
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:20,381
Somehow $100,000 finds its way
into my parent's bank account.

388
00:40:20,965 --> 00:40:23,259
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole
they've been tracing...

389
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:26,595
and I've been in the employ
of an arms dealer, Max...

390
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:28,097
for the last two years...

391
00:40:29,682 --> 00:40:31,267
to get him our NOC list.

392
00:40:33,227 --> 00:40:34,311
What are you gonna do?

393
00:40:35,646 --> 00:40:36,689
I'm gonna get it for him.

394
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:40,943
Ethan, you're not making any sense.

395
00:40:42,862 --> 00:40:44,071
Whoever the mole is...

396
00:40:45,114 --> 00:40:46,615
I think goes by the name of Job.

397
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,035
I can't find him, but if he knows
I have the NOC list...

398
00:40:51,996 --> 00:40:53,122
he'll find me.

399
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:56,375
I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna talk
to Kittridge myself.

400
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:58,627
And I'm gonna tell him
you had nothing to do with this.

401
00:40:58,752 --> 00:41:01,088
Claire, if you're not dead...

402
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:04,675
he's gonna assume you're with me.

403
00:41:20,149 --> 00:41:21,484
The message is for Job.

404
00:41:23,986 --> 00:41:27,114
That's right, and I'm gonna answer it.

405
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,389
Excuse me.

406
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:55,559
Can I trouble you for a match?

407
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:13,702
Would you remove your hat, please?

408
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,209
- Why?
- You wish to meet Max?

409
00:42:21,335 --> 00:42:22,878
The price of admission.

410
00:42:33,514 --> 00:42:36,475
- I thought I was going to see Max.
- You misunderstood.

411
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:38,143
No one sees Max.

412
00:42:39,645 --> 00:42:41,021
Then what the hell am I doing here?

413
00:42:42,356 --> 00:42:45,860
Allowing Max to see you
and hear what you've got to say.

414
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:48,946
Well, I don't communicate
very well through a shroud.

415
00:42:49,029 --> 00:42:51,949
Well, if Max doesn't like
what you have to say...

416
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:55,494
you'll be wearing
that shroud indefinitely.

417
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,123
I'm willing to take the chance.

418
00:43:05,004 --> 00:43:06,338
Very well.

419
00:43:10,676 --> 00:43:14,138
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

420
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,309
I need $150,000.

421
00:43:20,352 --> 00:43:21,478
Oh, really?

422
00:43:26,775 --> 00:43:28,194
And you thought...

423
00:43:28,277 --> 00:43:30,738
if you simply showed up,
I might give it to you?

424
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:34,200
Why not? You gave Job $125,000.

425
00:43:36,952 --> 00:43:40,873
The penny drops. You are not Job.

426
00:43:43,626 --> 00:43:47,630
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.

427
00:43:48,547 --> 00:43:52,927
Then there was its tone,
aggressive but playful.

428
00:43:53,052 --> 00:43:54,762
Job is not playful.

429
00:43:56,597 --> 00:43:59,850
So you are something of a paradox.

430
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:02,937
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

431
00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:05,481
Whether you like a paradox.

432
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:10,694
I want $150,000 today.

433
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:13,322
No, no. That's quite out of the question.

434
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:18,911
The disk Job sold you, it's worthless.

435
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,623
It's bait, part of an internal mole hunt.

436
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:30,005
And how might you know that?

437
00:44:32,091 --> 00:44:34,218
Are you another Company man?

438
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:37,888
Like Job?

439
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:44,103
We're asking about you.

440
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:47,690
I'm NOC. Was...

441
00:44:48,899 --> 00:44:50,401
Now, disavowed.

442
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:53,362
Why, may I ask?

443
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:56,365
That is the question I want to ask Job.

444
00:44:58,325 --> 00:45:02,163
I don't know Job any more
than Job knows me.

445
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:03,747
Even so...

446
00:45:04,165 --> 00:45:06,375
I'm sure
you could arrange an introduction.

447
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:07,668
Why should I?

448
00:45:07,793 --> 00:45:10,004
Because I can deliver
the actual NOC list.

449
00:45:10,296 --> 00:45:12,047
The one you have is
not only worthless...

450
00:45:12,173 --> 00:45:13,841
it's certain to be equipped
with a homing device...

451
00:45:13,924 --> 00:45:15,551
to pinpoint your exact location.

452
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,349
Boot it up.

453
00:45:23,142 --> 00:45:25,102
In anywhere from 30 seconds
to 10 minutes...

454
00:45:25,227 --> 00:45:28,189
you'll have Virginia farm boys
hopping around you like jackrabbits.

455
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:33,986
It's easy to say the disk is worthless...

456
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:36,405
when you say I can't look
at the information...

457
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:39,992
and see if it's worthless.
Not a tenable position, sir.

458
00:45:41,243 --> 00:45:44,330
Okay, use it. But...

459
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:47,500
I'd suggest you pack first.

460
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:05,726
26, 27. So far, so good.

461
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,562
Not so good for you, my friend.

462
00:46:08,687 --> 00:46:10,815
I'd say you've got about two minutes.

463
00:46:43,722 --> 00:46:45,099
32 and 33.

464
00:46:45,224 --> 00:46:48,310
Doesn't mean it's a signal.
Could just be the hard drive heating up.

465
00:46:56,068 --> 00:46:57,403
44 and 45.

466
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,919
Now.

467
00:47:46,202 --> 00:47:48,162
Man's gone black, Barnes.

468
00:47:49,538 --> 00:47:51,582
He's under until he decides to surface.

469
00:47:51,707 --> 00:47:54,585
Look, we can use somebody at the
embassy. Involve the local authorities.

470
00:47:54,668 --> 00:47:58,255
- We can cut off his transportation...
- What can we do, Barnes?

471
00:47:58,339 --> 00:48:00,299
Put a guy at the airport?

472
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:02,635
How many identities
do you think Hunt has?

473
00:48:02,718 --> 00:48:04,595
How many times has
he slipped past customs...

474
00:48:04,678 --> 00:48:06,514
in how many countries?

475
00:48:06,972 --> 00:48:08,766
These guys are trained to be ghosts.

476
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:11,852
We taught them to do it,
for Christ's sake.

477
00:48:11,977 --> 00:48:13,270
Well, what do you suggest?

478
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:18,734
Let's not waste time chasing after him,
just make him come to us.

479
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:21,320
Everybody has pressure points, Barnes.

480
00:48:21,445 --> 00:48:24,281
You find something
that's personally important to him...

481
00:48:24,406 --> 00:48:25,991
and you squeeze.

482
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:35,000
Gunther will never let me have
one of his apartments again.

483
00:48:37,002 --> 00:48:40,589
Sorry I doubted you, dear boy.
You are a good sport.

484
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:42,091
Thanks, Max.

485
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:44,718
Or is it Maxine?

486
00:48:46,846 --> 00:48:48,347
I don't have to tell you...

487
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:51,225
what a comfort anonymity can be
in my profession.

488
00:48:53,018 --> 00:48:55,020
It's like a warm blanket.

489
00:48:58,983 --> 00:49:02,027
My deal with Job was subject
to a successful boot scan.

490
00:49:02,153 --> 00:49:04,488
Obviously it didn't pass muster.
Deal's off.

491
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:07,950
What was your deal with Job?

492
00:49:08,868 --> 00:49:10,202
$6 million.

493
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:14,623
I'll give you the same,
but I want the complete list now...

494
00:49:14,748 --> 00:49:16,167
not just Eastern Europe.

495
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,252
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous.

496
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,713
- I want the entire list.
- $10 million.

497
00:49:21,881 --> 00:49:24,175
$10 million in negotiable
US Treasury certificates...

498
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,677
in bearer form, coupons attached.

499
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:28,762
And one more thing.

500
00:49:30,723 --> 00:49:35,060
Your personal assurance
that Job will be at the exchange.

501
00:49:48,324 --> 00:49:49,283
Oh.

502
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:53,245
Max made a deal with you?

503
00:49:54,872 --> 00:49:57,666
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.

504
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,424
We've got 75 rounds for your Beretta
but only 20 for the SIG Sauer.

505
00:50:05,966 --> 00:50:08,302
One pair of Visco glasses
with monitor...

506
00:50:09,345 --> 00:50:10,888
plenty of passports, and...

507
00:50:16,352 --> 00:50:17,478
What?

508
00:50:18,479 --> 00:50:20,356
You said it yourself.

509
00:50:20,773 --> 00:50:22,525
If I'm not dead, I'm with you.

510
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:25,736
Are you sure about this?

511
00:50:26,695 --> 00:50:28,239
Jim was my husband.

512
00:50:28,364 --> 00:50:30,616
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.

513
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,286
We're gonna need some help.

514
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:37,540
We don't have a lot of time,
so they're gonna have to be local.

515
00:50:38,374 --> 00:50:39,416
What kind of help?

516
00:51:13,534 --> 00:51:14,910
Simple game.

517
00:51:15,828 --> 00:51:17,246
Four players.

518
00:51:17,746 --> 00:51:19,623
Exfil opens the pocket.

519
00:51:19,832 --> 00:51:21,500
Cyber ops lifts the wallet.

520
00:51:22,793 --> 00:51:23,836
Bank?

521
00:51:24,795 --> 00:51:25,963
IMF mainframe.

522
00:51:27,756 --> 00:51:29,049
Where exactly is it?

523
00:51:29,758 --> 00:51:30,843
In Langley.

524
00:51:34,054 --> 00:51:35,014
In Langley?

525
00:51:36,557 --> 00:51:37,766
The one in Virginia, Langley?

526
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,021
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?

527
00:51:43,898 --> 00:51:44,857
Is he serious?

528
00:51:46,025 --> 00:51:46,984
Always.

529
00:51:49,361 --> 00:51:53,073
If we're going to Virginia,
why don't we drop by Fort Knox?

530
00:51:53,282 --> 00:51:55,993
I can fly a helicopter right in
through the lobby...

531
00:51:56,076 --> 00:51:57,745
and set it down inside the vault...

532
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:01,582
and it would be a hell of a lot easier
than breaking into the goddamn CIA.

533
00:52:01,707 --> 00:52:02,875
What are we downloading?

534
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:05,586
- Information.
- What kind?

535
00:52:06,003 --> 00:52:07,087
Profitable.

536
00:52:08,214 --> 00:52:09,632
Payment on delivery.

537
00:52:12,426 --> 00:52:13,427
I don't know.

538
00:52:14,887 --> 00:52:16,055
I just don't know.

539
00:52:19,058 --> 00:52:21,185
This doesn't sound like
the Luther Stickell I heard of.

540
00:52:22,686 --> 00:52:24,480
What did they used to call you,
the Net Ranger?

541
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,190
Phineas Phreak?

542
00:52:27,608 --> 00:52:30,361
The only man alive
who actually hacked NATO Ghost Com.

543
00:52:30,569 --> 00:52:33,906
There was never any physical evidence
that I had anything to do with that.

544
00:52:35,407 --> 00:52:36,784
With that...

545
00:52:37,618 --> 00:52:39,870
that exceptional piece of work.

546
00:52:43,916 --> 00:52:45,209
You don't know what you're missing.

547
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:50,840
- This is the Mount Everest of hacks.
- Y'all are kidding yourselves.

548
00:52:52,132 --> 00:52:56,053
Even with top of the line crypto,
Cray access, STU-III...

549
00:52:56,136 --> 00:52:58,138
Krieger can get it, right?

550
00:53:00,057 --> 00:53:01,392
May take a little time.

551
00:53:01,517 --> 00:53:02,726
What the hell do you mean,
"a little time"?

552
00:53:03,644 --> 00:53:05,020
That's not what Claire tells me
about you.

553
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:07,857
Thinking-machine laptops.

554
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:14,363
I'm talking about the 686 prototypes
with the artificial intelligence risk chip.

555
00:53:15,281 --> 00:53:16,532
24 hours.

556
00:53:19,118 --> 00:53:22,705
And I get to keep the equipment
when we're done.

557
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:25,374
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.

558
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:34,633
Look, I just can't hack my way inside.

559
00:53:35,926 --> 00:53:38,387
See, there's no modem access
to the mainframe.

560
00:53:39,346 --> 00:53:40,806
It's in what we call the stand-alone...

561
00:53:41,974 --> 00:53:45,561
which means I'd have to be physically
at the terminal.

562
00:53:47,021 --> 00:53:48,439
Relax, Luther.

563
00:53:49,106 --> 00:53:50,399
It's much worse than you think.

564
00:53:51,859 --> 00:53:53,986
The terminal is
in a black vault lockdown.

565
00:53:54,737 --> 00:53:56,405
<i>The only person allowed in the room...</i>

566
00:53:56,489 --> 00:53:58,908
<i>has to pass through a series
of security checks.</i>

567
00:53:59,033 --> 00:54:00,367
William Donloe.

568
00:54:01,285 --> 00:54:05,498
<i>The first is a voiceprint identification
and a six-digit access code.</i>

569
00:54:09,126 --> 00:54:10,711
<i>This only gets him into the outer room.</i>

570
00:54:12,588 --> 00:54:14,507
<i>Next, he has to pass a retinal scan.</i>

571
00:54:18,761 --> 00:54:21,430
<i>And finally,
the intrusion countermeasures...</i>

572
00:54:21,514 --> 00:54:24,683
<i>are only deactivated
by a double-electronic keycard...</i>

573
00:54:25,476 --> 00:54:26,477
which we won't have.

574
00:54:29,021 --> 00:54:31,232
<i>Now, inside the black vault...</i>

575
00:54:31,524 --> 00:54:33,150
<i>there are three systems operating...</i>

576
00:54:33,275 --> 00:54:36,070
<i>whenever the technician
is out of the room.</i>

577
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:40,658
<i>The first is sound-sensitive.
Anything above a whisper sets it off.</i>

578
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:45,538
<i>The second system
detects any increase in temperature.</i>

579
00:54:45,621 --> 00:54:48,374
<i>Even the body heat
of an unauthorized person in the room...</i>

580
00:54:48,457 --> 00:54:51,502
<i>will trigger it if the temperature rises
just a single degree.</i>

581
00:54:56,924 --> 00:55:00,010
<i>Now, that temperature is controlled
by the air conditioning...</i>

582
00:55:00,135 --> 00:55:03,264
<i>coming in through an overhead duct,
30 feet above the floor.</i>

583
00:55:06,016 --> 00:55:08,477
<i>That vent is guarded by a laser net.</i>

584
00:55:11,939 --> 00:55:15,151
<i>The third system is on the floor,
and is pressure-sensitive.</i>

585
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:19,363
<i>The slightest increase in weight
will trigger the alarm.</i>

586
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:23,075
<i>And any one of these systems,
if set off...</i>

587
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:25,744
<i>will activate an automatic lockdown.</i>

588
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:29,957
<i>Now, believe me
when I tell you, gentlemen...</i>

589
00:55:30,499 --> 00:55:33,586
<i>all three systems are state-of-the-art.</i>

590
00:55:38,048 --> 00:55:39,758
And you really think we can do this?

591
00:55:43,929 --> 00:55:44,930
We're going to do it.

592
00:56:18,172 --> 00:56:20,633
We picked up alarms
in Sector 3, 7, and 12.

593
00:56:20,758 --> 00:56:23,511
<i>Yeah, that's what I've got, too.
What sector's the air conditioning?</i>

594
00:56:23,636 --> 00:56:26,096
<i>21, but there's no alarm in Sector 21.</i>

595
00:56:26,222 --> 00:56:28,015
<i>No, I gotta get in there and shut it down.</i>

596
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,808
<i>I'm sorry,
but nobody gets into any sector...</i>

597
00:56:29,892 --> 00:56:30,935
<i>where an alarm hasn't gone off.</i>

598
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,895
<i>You wanna blow the fire
through this whole building?</i>

599
00:56:32,978 --> 00:56:35,606
<i>Look, no one goes into any sector
where the alarm hasn't gone off...</i>

600
00:56:35,689 --> 00:56:38,234
<i>- and it hasn't gone off in 21.
- Wait.</i>

601
00:56:42,905 --> 00:56:44,323
<i>It's gone off. Let's go.</i>

602
00:56:44,406 --> 00:56:45,741
Let's move.

603
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,589
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

604
00:57:03,509 --> 00:57:05,177
21's through here.

605
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,519
He's recruiting.

606
00:57:13,644 --> 00:57:16,105
- For what purpose?
- Survival.

607
00:57:16,522 --> 00:57:19,400
Too shortsighted. This guy initiates.
He's proactive.

608
00:57:19,525 --> 00:57:22,862
The question is, what does he want?
Where does he need to get it?

609
00:57:22,987 --> 00:57:25,447
And Barnes, what the hell's that noise?

610
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:27,825
Fire alarm, Gene.

611
00:57:31,287 --> 00:57:32,621
Do we have to evacuate?

612
00:58:20,711 --> 00:58:23,547
Hey, there were three of you.
Where's the other guy?

613
00:58:25,382 --> 00:58:27,968
Krieger! Zero body count.

614
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:29,803
We'll see.

615
01:00:03,397 --> 01:00:04,482
Hi there.

616
01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:09,713
One, two, three.

617
01:01:10,506 --> 01:01:12,716
Toast. Toast.

618
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:15,845
<i>- Check.
- Good.</i>

619
01:01:17,763 --> 01:01:19,390
Okay, Luther, I'm going in.

620
01:01:19,515 --> 01:01:22,852
<i>Everest, man.
You ready to plant the flag?</i>

621
01:01:31,193 --> 01:01:32,278
Damn.

622
01:01:32,403 --> 01:01:36,240
Krieger, from here on in,
absolute silence.

623
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,109
He's rolling to you.

624
01:02:58,405 --> 01:03:00,074
He's at the voiceprint corridor.

625
01:03:00,491 --> 01:03:01,450
William Donloe.

626
01:03:17,675 --> 01:03:18,759
Outer room.

627
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:25,349
He's coming in the vault.

628
01:03:31,147 --> 01:03:32,148
Come on, move.

629
01:05:01,237 --> 01:05:02,613
He's in the bathroom.

630
01:06:20,357 --> 01:06:22,693
A- W-9...

631
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:24,820
<i>6- B-6.</i>

632
01:06:44,548 --> 01:06:46,217
Holy mother of God.

633
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,135
<i>The NOC list.</i>

634
01:09:45,771 --> 01:09:47,106
He's at the vault.

635
01:10:00,661 --> 01:10:01,871
Four yellows.

636
01:10:05,082 --> 01:10:06,041
One red.

637
01:10:17,636 --> 01:10:18,762
Get moving.

638
01:10:20,639 --> 01:10:21,640
Toast.

639
01:10:23,184 --> 01:10:24,185
Toast.

640
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:29,231
<i>Merci.</i>

641
01:11:27,164 --> 01:11:28,374
Oh, my God.

642
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:40,928
Yeah.

643
01:11:44,306 --> 01:11:45,808
It's for you.

644
01:11:47,768 --> 01:11:48,811
Kittridge.

645
01:12:12,168 --> 01:12:16,505
You and I know about this.
That's where it stops, you understand?

646
01:12:16,589 --> 01:12:18,174
It never happened.

647
01:12:18,299 --> 01:12:19,800
What about him?

648
01:12:20,176 --> 01:12:23,637
I want him manning a radar tower
in Alaska by the end of the day.

649
01:12:23,762 --> 01:12:25,389
Just mail him his clothes.

650
01:13:04,512 --> 01:13:05,679
You contacting your buyer?

651
01:13:08,057 --> 01:13:09,183
Ethan.

652
01:13:15,231 --> 01:13:16,357
Ethan.

653
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:24,198
Ethan.

654
01:13:27,243 --> 01:13:29,286
Excuse me. Mr. Hunt.

655
01:13:39,338 --> 01:13:41,215
You're not going to any meeting
without me.

656
01:13:43,884 --> 01:13:46,512
My contact is extremely shy.

657
01:13:49,098 --> 01:13:52,810
I don't think you're in any position
to give orders. Do you?

658
01:13:53,185 --> 01:13:55,396
Not while I'm holding this.

659
01:13:55,938 --> 01:13:57,898
<i>- Krieger...
- Ta gueule.</i>

660
01:14:03,571 --> 01:14:04,572
Don't you mean this?

661
01:14:05,739 --> 01:14:06,907
That's not the list.

662
01:14:07,616 --> 01:14:10,286
Oh, what's the matter?
You, you've never seen this trick?

663
01:14:18,586 --> 01:14:20,045
Where'd it go?

664
01:14:24,216 --> 01:14:25,217
It's gone.

665
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,845
What?

666
01:14:28,596 --> 01:14:29,597
- You.
- No.

667
01:14:29,722 --> 01:14:30,681
No?

668
01:14:37,563 --> 01:14:38,898
But not too far.

669
01:14:43,277 --> 01:14:45,738
I know what you're thinking, Krieger.

670
01:14:45,821 --> 01:14:47,656
You're thinking,
"Back in the computer room...

671
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:50,242
"I was up here, he was down there.

672
01:14:52,953 --> 01:14:54,663
"Yes, and he was...

673
01:14:55,789 --> 01:14:58,042
"He was carrying two disks. "

674
01:15:00,377 --> 01:15:02,379
It's so hard
to keep track of these things.

675
01:15:03,672 --> 01:15:04,715
Where is it?

676
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:22,441
Do you actually think
I'd let you have the NOC list?

677
01:15:24,443 --> 01:15:26,904
Try any sleight of hand with my money,
I'll cut your throat.

678
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:57,351
<i>You're off on one of your cushy
recruiting assignments again?</i>

679
01:15:57,434 --> 01:15:59,645
<i>Yeah, where'd they put you up
this time, The Plaza?</i>

680
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:01,105
<i>Drake Hotel, Chicago.</i>

681
01:16:04,066 --> 01:16:05,526
I'm so sorry.

682
01:16:12,116 --> 01:16:13,909
Krieger was my call.

683
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:22,293
I'm sorry, Ethan.

684
01:16:27,631 --> 01:16:29,550
We did what we had to do.

685
01:16:31,427 --> 01:16:33,888
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

686
01:17:12,927 --> 01:17:14,220
Krieger did have the NOC list?

687
01:17:24,605 --> 01:17:25,898
Now I want you to hold on to it.

688
01:17:25,981 --> 01:17:27,107
What makes you trust me?

689
01:17:27,733 --> 01:17:29,443
Because if you knew
what you were getting into...

690
01:17:29,568 --> 01:17:30,903
you never would have done it.

691
01:17:36,867 --> 01:17:38,953
I'm not going to let this
get out in the open.

692
01:17:40,412 --> 01:17:42,790
Exactly. That's your job tomorrow,
on the train.

693
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:45,876
Don't let this NOC list
get out in the open.

694
01:17:53,425 --> 01:17:54,635
What is the range of this thing?

695
01:17:56,178 --> 01:17:58,973
It's hard to tell.
I'm gonna have to be close.

696
01:18:00,766 --> 01:18:02,143
Ethan, I need to talk to you.

697
01:18:03,853 --> 01:18:06,897
<i>The unlikely setting,
a farm in the heartland of America...</i>

698
01:18:06,981 --> 01:18:08,524
<i>the state of Wisconsin...</i>

699
01:18:08,607 --> 01:18:10,609
<i>where federal agents claim
to have found...</i>

700
01:18:10,693 --> 01:18:13,237
<i>the brains behind
an international drugs ring.</i>

701
01:18:13,737 --> 01:18:16,907
<i>The operation was masterminded
by Margaret Ethan Hunt...</i>

702
01:18:16,991 --> 01:18:19,243
<i>and her brother-in-law, Donald Hunt.</i>

703
01:18:19,326 --> 01:18:22,580
<i>They were arrested this morning
by drug enforcement officers...</i>

704
01:18:22,663 --> 01:18:24,165
<i>in a major sting operation...</i>

705
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:27,251
<i>designed to expose
the illegal manufacture...</i>

706
01:18:27,334 --> 01:18:29,962
<i>of the drug methcathinone,
known as khat.</i>

707
01:18:30,087 --> 01:18:33,048
<i>I'm afraid what we have here is
a case of a naive and lonely widower...</i>

708
01:18:33,132 --> 01:18:33,716
Kittridge.

709
01:19:03,245 --> 01:19:04,246
Kittridge.

710
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:06,332
I see you've been out visiting the folks.

711
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:08,792
It's Hunt.
What do you need for a pinpoint?

712
01:19:10,169 --> 01:19:13,130
You've been watching a little TV,
have you?

713
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:18,594
Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles
was an especially nice touch.

714
01:19:18,886 --> 01:19:20,638
- He's in England.
- Get Ml5.

715
01:19:21,388 --> 01:19:22,807
Ethan, I wanna assure you...

716
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:26,352
that my first order of business
after you come in...

717
01:19:26,435 --> 01:19:29,897
is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped...

718
01:19:30,022 --> 01:19:32,858
and eliminated completely
from their files.

719
01:19:32,942 --> 01:19:35,361
Look, if you come in now...

720
01:19:35,444 --> 01:19:38,739
<i>we can plea down
the charges against you, as well.</i>

721
01:19:40,825 --> 01:19:42,535
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?

722
01:19:44,328 --> 01:19:45,663
Certainly, Ethan.

723
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,706
If you're dealing with someone...

724
01:19:49,124 --> 01:19:51,293
<i>who's crushed, stabbed...</i>

725
01:19:51,919 --> 01:19:54,296
shot, and detonated...

726
01:19:55,005 --> 01:19:57,842
<i>five members of his own IMF team...</i>

727
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:01,345
how devastated
do you think you're gonna make him...

728
01:20:01,428 --> 01:20:04,640
by marching Ma and Uncle Donald
down to the county courthouse?

729
01:20:04,765 --> 01:20:07,768
<i>I don't know, Ethan.
Why don't you tell me?</i>

730
01:20:11,105 --> 01:20:12,356
Lost him.

731
01:20:14,066 --> 01:20:15,526
We needed three more seconds.

732
01:20:15,609 --> 01:20:18,237
He wanted us to know
he was in London.

733
01:20:31,959 --> 01:20:33,419
You're a hard man to catch up with.

734
01:20:42,678 --> 01:20:45,473
Next day I managed to drag myself
back to the safe house.

735
01:20:45,598 --> 01:20:46,807
I must have just missed you.

736
01:20:46,932 --> 01:20:49,727
Anyway, I checked our aliases.

737
01:20:49,977 --> 01:20:51,479
And that's when you picked us up
in the States.

738
01:20:51,979 --> 01:20:54,899
But you left before I could get there,
and I could check just so many places.

739
01:20:55,316 --> 01:20:57,735
Smaller countries don't computerize
customs records.

740
01:20:58,027 --> 01:20:59,361
So I watched Europe.

741
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:03,199
Once you turned up in England,
it was easy.

742
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:06,118
You knew
I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.

743
01:21:06,202 --> 01:21:07,870
Hey, I showed them to you.

744
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:11,081
I remember.

745
01:21:13,876 --> 01:21:16,504
Jim, look, who do you think
you're kidding here?

746
01:21:16,587 --> 01:21:18,881
A doctor's gotta look at that.
You can't sit up straight.

747
01:21:19,006 --> 01:21:20,466
I can sit up straight.

748
01:21:21,217 --> 01:21:22,760
I just can't sit up straight very well.

749
01:21:23,636 --> 01:21:26,305
Sit down. Sit down. It's not important.

750
01:21:28,057 --> 01:21:29,058
Ethan...

751
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,271
I saw who shot me. I saw the mole.

752
01:21:36,357 --> 01:21:39,401
- It was Kittridge.
- Kittridge.

753
01:21:40,402 --> 01:21:42,029
Kittridge, Ethan.

754
01:21:47,618 --> 01:21:49,411
Kittridge is the mole.

755
01:21:50,454 --> 01:21:52,456
My God, of course. You're right.

756
01:21:58,629 --> 01:22:00,089
He was at the embassy that night.

757
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:07,847
First, he took out Jack at the elevator.

758
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:17,523
He shot you on the bridge.

759
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:48,888
<i>Ethan!</i>

760
01:23:02,693 --> 01:23:05,446
He must have had backup take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

761
01:23:24,757 --> 01:23:26,550
How did he do Hannah?

762
01:23:52,117 --> 01:23:54,912
No. No,
he could have done Hannah himself.

763
01:24:22,356 --> 01:24:23,607
Why, Jim?

764
01:24:25,651 --> 01:24:26,652
Why?

765
01:24:29,738 --> 01:24:31,824
When you think about it, Ethan,
it was inevitable.

766
01:24:31,907 --> 01:24:33,492
No more Cold War.

767
01:24:35,202 --> 01:24:38,038
No more secrets
you keep from everyone but yourself.

768
01:24:38,164 --> 01:24:41,041
Operations, you answer
to no one but yourself.

769
01:24:41,917 --> 01:24:45,171
And then one day, you wake up,
the President of the United States is...

770
01:24:45,296 --> 01:24:47,006
running the country
without your permission.

771
01:24:48,174 --> 01:24:49,925
The son of a bitch, how dare he?

772
01:24:51,552 --> 01:24:53,637
Then you realize, it's over.

773
01:24:54,346 --> 01:24:57,057
You're an obsolete piece of hardware
not worth upgrading.

774
01:24:57,183 --> 01:25:00,227
You've got a lousy marriage
and 62 grand a year.

775
01:25:02,313 --> 01:25:03,647
Kittridge.

776
01:25:04,398 --> 01:25:07,026
We'll go after
the no-good son of a bitch big time.

777
01:25:12,364 --> 01:25:15,826
We won't have to. He'll come after us.

778
01:25:17,661 --> 01:25:19,872
What's gonna make him do that?

779
01:25:19,955 --> 01:25:23,334
What he didn't get in Prague.
The NOC list.

780
01:25:25,794 --> 01:25:28,798
Whoa. Jesus, Ethan.

781
01:25:30,591 --> 01:25:32,051
Good for you.

782
01:25:33,803 --> 01:25:36,889
I'm meeting him tomorrow
on the TGV en route to Paris.

783
01:25:37,056 --> 01:25:39,266
Tight security. No guns.

784
01:25:39,809 --> 01:25:41,143
A real plus.

785
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:43,938
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list
to Max...

786
01:25:44,063 --> 01:25:45,940
Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.

787
01:25:46,649 --> 01:25:48,776
I'll have Claire and Luther Stickell
with me on the train.

788
01:25:48,859 --> 01:25:51,278
Krieger is gonna have
helicopter transport waiting in Paris.

789
01:25:54,865 --> 01:25:55,866
Jim?

790
01:26:05,709 --> 01:26:07,461
I was in a cafe waiting for you, Ethan.

791
01:26:11,215 --> 01:26:12,424
And there she was...

792
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:16,846
standing in the rain,
alive and beautiful...

793
01:26:17,346 --> 01:26:18,806
thinking I'm dead and gone.

794
01:26:22,935 --> 01:26:25,479
God knows what she's had to do
to forget me...

795
01:26:25,604 --> 01:26:27,523
to keep going, get the job done.

796
01:26:32,486 --> 01:26:33,904
She can't know about me, Ethan.

797
01:26:34,029 --> 01:26:36,198
No one can, not till this is over.

798
01:26:36,949 --> 01:26:37,908
You're probably right.

799
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:41,036
There's too much at stake.

800
01:26:43,664 --> 01:26:46,417
Once we leave the safe house, Jim,
you get in there and crash.

801
01:26:48,377 --> 01:26:51,130
- I'll call you from Paris.
- You got it.

802
01:27:14,945 --> 01:27:15,946
What happened?

803
01:27:20,326 --> 01:27:21,785
I sent the message to Max.

804
01:27:26,665 --> 01:27:27,750
We're on for tomorrow.

805
01:27:35,966 --> 01:27:36,967
Okay.

806
01:27:47,603 --> 01:27:48,562
Come here.

807
01:28:31,147 --> 01:28:32,189
Sir.

808
01:28:33,149 --> 01:28:34,984
- What's this?
- Incoming, sir, for you.

809
01:28:35,067 --> 01:28:37,695
X- ray's clean, electronics,
and no explosives.

810
01:28:49,248 --> 01:28:50,291
Gene?

811
01:28:55,713 --> 01:28:58,466
- How long to the London Terminus?
- Twenty, twenty-five minutes.

812
01:28:58,591 --> 01:29:00,092
You've got 10 minutes. Move!

813
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:39,882
<i>- Yes?
- Give me Max.</i>

814
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:42,009
It's him.

815
01:29:45,805 --> 01:29:47,640
This was not what we discussed.

816
01:29:47,723 --> 01:29:50,434
<i>My apologies, Max.
It couldn't be helped.</i>

817
01:29:50,768 --> 01:29:52,728
<i>There's a piece of black cloth
under your seat.</i>

818
01:29:52,853 --> 01:29:54,313
<i>Tear it away, you'll find the disk.</i>

819
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:31,142
Dear boy...

820
01:30:32,685 --> 01:30:36,105
I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

821
01:30:36,272 --> 01:30:38,149
<i>Not as long as you tell me
where the money is.</i>

822
01:30:38,941 --> 01:30:41,777
The mere possibility is
worth $10 million.

823
01:30:41,902 --> 01:30:44,029
Baggage car, rack 3.

824
01:30:44,196 --> 01:30:47,867
Silver briefcase, combination 3-1-4.

825
01:30:48,534 --> 01:30:50,077
<i>What about Job?</i>

826
01:30:50,161 --> 01:30:53,706
Wouldn't worry about him.
When you get the money, he'll find you.

827
01:31:11,557 --> 01:31:13,184
What's the matter?

828
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:15,811
- It's not transmitting.
- Try it. Try it again.

829
01:31:15,936 --> 01:31:19,023
Damn it, I've got to get this through
before we hit the Chunnel.

830
01:31:31,911 --> 01:31:34,371
- What's the problem?
- Connection denied.

831
01:31:35,414 --> 01:31:38,083
I can see that.
Did you check the batteries?

832
01:31:38,209 --> 01:31:40,294
I always check the batteries.

833
01:31:40,377 --> 01:31:43,005
Don't you give me that.
Run it through from the top.

834
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:48,969
This is bullshit.

835
01:31:49,053 --> 01:31:50,721
We don't even know
what Max looks like.

836
01:31:51,013 --> 01:31:52,681
Look, we don't need to know.

837
01:31:53,057 --> 01:31:54,892
If he's got that list,
he's gonna want to check it.

838
01:31:55,017 --> 01:31:56,227
And that means laptops.

839
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:10,866
Excuse me, sir. Your telephone.

840
01:32:10,991 --> 01:32:13,202
Hello? Hello?

841
01:32:14,787 --> 01:32:16,622
I can't hear anything.

842
01:32:17,581 --> 01:32:20,459
- Is everything all right, sir?
- It's just the battery is gone.

843
01:32:20,584 --> 01:32:21,961
It's working.

844
01:32:34,306 --> 01:32:36,183
He's in the baggage car.

845
01:32:38,018 --> 01:32:40,312
Ethan, Kittridge is on the train.

846
01:32:40,437 --> 01:32:41,689
<i>I'm right behind you.</i>

847
01:32:41,814 --> 01:32:43,899
<i>The money's in the baggage car.
I'll meet you there.</i>

848
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:02,459
Barnes?

849
01:33:40,664 --> 01:33:42,082
Ethan's right behind me.

850
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:47,880
Listen, Jim,
is it such a good idea to kill him?

851
01:33:52,384 --> 01:33:53,552
Kittridge is here.

852
01:33:57,848 --> 01:33:58,849
We take the money.

853
01:34:00,017 --> 01:34:01,477
Ethan takes the blame.

854
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:05,981
No one else has seen you alive.

855
01:34:09,109 --> 01:34:11,403
No one will believe him.

856
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:40,391
Of course...

857
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:43,269
I'm very sorry
to hear you say that, Claire.

858
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:48,858
- Ethan.
- Yes.

859
01:34:50,359 --> 01:34:53,445
Ethan Hunt, darling.
You remember him, don't you?

860
01:34:55,823 --> 01:34:58,409
- You knew about Jim?
- Of course.

861
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:03,956
Just exactly when he knew
is something of a question.

862
01:35:04,039 --> 01:35:05,249
Mind telling me, Ethan?

863
01:35:06,584 --> 01:35:08,252
Before or after I showed up in London?

864
01:35:10,045 --> 01:35:11,505
Before London...

865
01:35:11,797 --> 01:35:14,675
but after you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

866
01:35:16,218 --> 01:35:19,305
They stamped it, didn't they?
Those damn Gideons.

867
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:24,602
Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why...

868
01:35:24,727 --> 01:35:27,605
Why the masquerade?
Why take the risk?

869
01:35:28,481 --> 01:35:31,400
Well, Claire, you've asked the question.

870
01:35:32,443 --> 01:35:33,611
And you are the answer.

871
01:35:35,196 --> 01:35:36,655
I knew about Jim.

872
01:35:36,989 --> 01:35:38,491
But he didn't know about you.

873
01:35:39,783 --> 01:35:41,202
In all fairness, Ethan...

874
01:35:41,285 --> 01:35:44,038
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

875
01:35:45,247 --> 01:35:48,792
But I was supremely confident,
having tasted the goods.

876
01:35:51,295 --> 01:35:56,258
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife," Ethan.

877
01:35:58,052 --> 01:36:00,471
Let's just get the money
and get out of here.

878
01:36:00,596 --> 01:36:01,764
Yes, let's get the money.

879
01:36:02,932 --> 01:36:05,976
Ethan, the money.

880
01:36:08,646 --> 01:36:09,730
Give her the money.

881
01:36:13,859 --> 01:36:14,944
You've earned it.

882
01:36:22,785 --> 01:36:24,411
All $10 million.

883
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:27,665
You know, Claire was wrong
about one thing, Jim.

884
01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:29,208
Oh?

885
01:36:29,959 --> 01:36:30,960
What's that?

886
01:36:50,396 --> 01:36:52,064
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.

887
01:36:54,024 --> 01:36:56,485
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.

888
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:01,740
You son of a bitch.

889
01:37:02,199 --> 01:37:03,200
It's over, Jim.

890
01:37:10,124 --> 01:37:12,751
Don't. Don't, Jim.

891
01:37:12,877 --> 01:37:13,836
"Don't, Jim. "

892
01:40:24,819 --> 01:40:25,778
Damn!

893
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:31,075
No, it's in the tunnel!

894
01:40:31,867 --> 01:40:33,994
No, no, don't! It'll crash into us!

895
01:40:34,078 --> 01:40:35,955
Accelerate! Accelerate!

896
01:42:37,827 --> 01:42:39,161
Red light!

897
01:42:40,412 --> 01:42:41,747
Green light!

898
01:43:30,087 --> 01:43:34,425
Look, we cannot just be
sitting around, okay? We need...

899
01:43:34,508 --> 01:43:36,302
I think this is what you're looking for.

900
01:43:43,267 --> 01:43:44,685
Hello, Max.

901
01:43:45,644 --> 01:43:48,647
My lawyers are going
to have a field day with this.

902
01:43:48,772 --> 01:43:51,358
Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict...

903
01:43:51,484 --> 01:43:54,778
Well, maybe we'll
just leave the courts out of this one.

904
01:43:57,531 --> 01:44:02,119
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

905
01:44:02,495 --> 01:44:03,829
<i>In a freak accident...</i>

906
01:44:03,913 --> 01:44:07,333
<i>a helicopter lost altitude,
veered into a tunnel...</i>

907
01:44:07,416 --> 01:44:11,545
<i>and collided with a high-speed train
on its way from London to Paris.</i>

908
01:44:12,004 --> 01:44:15,591
<i>The pilot was killed,
but no one on the train was hurt.</i>

909
01:44:16,050 --> 01:44:19,678
<i>Authorities have attributed the accident
to instrument failure.</i>

910
01:44:19,762 --> 01:44:22,556
Reach your folks? How are they feeling?

911
01:44:22,681 --> 01:44:24,058
About what?

912
01:44:24,308 --> 01:44:27,895
The apology from
the Justice Department, VIP treatment...

913
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:30,272
you know, the whole nine yards.

914
01:44:30,856 --> 01:44:32,900
Well, my mom was a little confused...

915
01:44:33,025 --> 01:44:35,569
how the DEA could mistake
her and Uncle Donald...

916
01:44:35,694 --> 01:44:38,113
for a couple of dope smugglers
in the Florida Keys.

917
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:42,368
Cheers.

918
01:44:43,953 --> 01:44:47,414
To you, Luther,
for being off the disavowed list.

919
01:44:47,498 --> 01:44:48,958
Hey, I'm the flavor of the month.

920
01:44:52,586 --> 01:44:53,921
Why don't you come back with me?

921
01:44:56,841 --> 01:44:58,217
I just...

922
01:44:58,592 --> 01:45:00,302
I just don't know why I'd be doing it.

923
01:45:03,264 --> 01:45:05,266
Gotta go catch my flight.

924
01:45:06,475 --> 01:45:08,435
So how's it feel
to be a solid citizen again?

925
01:45:11,105 --> 01:45:12,731
Man, I don't know.

926
01:45:14,817 --> 01:45:16,610
I'm gonna miss being disreputable.

927
01:45:17,486 --> 01:45:20,197
Well, Luther,
if it makes you feel any better...

928
01:45:20,322 --> 01:45:21,615
I'll always think of you that way.

929
01:45:33,502 --> 01:45:35,254
Excuse me. Mr. Hunt?

930
01:45:36,922 --> 01:45:38,340
Would you like to watch a movie?

931
01:45:42,511 --> 01:45:43,971
No, thank you.

932
01:45:44,263 --> 01:45:46,682
Would you consider
the cinema of the Caribbean?

933
01:45:49,435 --> 01:45:50,936
Aruba, perhaps?
