00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:39,881
Oh, we've been at
this all day, buddy, I get it.

3
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:41,750
Those other spots
didn't float your boat,

4
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:44,720
but wait until you see
this next place.

5
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:46,321
It screams mouse house.

6
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:47,422
Wait, can I say that?

7
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:48,456
Is that copyrighted?

8
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:49,624
Heh. There we go.

9
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,025
Whoop. Sorry about this,

10
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:53,628
the elevator's, uh,
being repaired.

11
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,898
Boom!
I just had a vision!

12
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:57,399
You're chillin'
in your new crib,

13
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:58,800
but then
you get claustrophobic,

14
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,270
and then you get dizzy,
and to save you...

15
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:02,437
Ta-da!

16
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:04,405
Look at that view!

17
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:07,075
Resplendent, ain't it, huh?

18
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:08,477
It's got everything.

19
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:09,978
Built-in stereo,

20
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:12,047
but be careful, those seats
are very flammable.

21
00:02:12,114 --> 00:02:14,649
I'm kidding.
I'm not kidding.

22
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:16,652
Jerry, baby,
I know it's no beauty,

23
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:17,953
but let's be honest here,

24
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:20,255
with your budget,
this is all you can...

25
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:22,691
Hey! You don't just Batman me.

26
00:02:22,757 --> 00:02:24,659
You haven't even seen
the trunk yet.

27
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,660
Ahhh!

28
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:19,681
Look, Dad. That blind cat's
playing piano.

29
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:22,184
There's a lot of weird stuff
in this city.

30
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:24,853
You just gotta keep walking.

31
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,256
I mean,
he's amazing on the piano,

32
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:28,658
and blind, too!

33
00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:31,660
That's one cool cat.

34
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:47,342
Man,
that cat is out of sight!

35
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:50,680
This is so cool.

36
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:54,782
Whoa!

37
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,352
Oh, wow! Isn't he cute?

38
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,325
I thought I'd seen it all with
the blind, piano-playing cat.

39
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:23,745
Oh, man.

40
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:32,888
He can see!

41
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:34,188
He's a fraud!

42
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:35,724
He's a regular cat
playing the piano.

43
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,425
Man, I want my money back!

44
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,215
Ahhh.

45
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,592
Hey. Are you okay?

46
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:44,759
You gotta be careful next time.

47
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:45,894
You could have really hurt me.

48
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:49,732
Oh, my gosh.

49
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,905
Suspended? Why?

50
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,572
<i>For starters,</i>

51
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,775
<i>the 100 pounds of underwear
strewn up 5th Avenue.</i>

52
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,276
Oh, come on,
you can't blame me for that.

53
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:03,345
That was
a cat-and-mouse situation,

54
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,547
and everyone knows
you just don't get involved.

55
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:07,114
<i>You can reapply in four weeks.</i>

56
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:09,751
No. Please, sir,
please, just...

57
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:12,187
You... You...
You can't do that to me.

58
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:13,420
<i>Oh.</i>

59
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:16,257
Last week, I helped a man
do a pull-up for an hour.

60
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:18,960
An hour! He achieved
his fitness goals with me.

61
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:20,562
Okay.

62
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:22,864
What if I just...

63
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:24,566
I come and be your assistant?

64
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:26,902
<i>Ms. Forester,
you started two months ago.</i>

65
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,138
<i>It just doesn't work like that.</i>

66
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:31,873
Maybe this job
never was for me.

67
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,175
- <i>Maybe it's not.</i>
- You know what? I quit.

68
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:43,352
HORSE: Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

69
00:06:49,157 --> 00:06:50,092
Whoa!

70
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:44,146
- Hello.
- Hey.

71
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:45,814
Back for another free meal?

72
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:38,100
So, you new in town?

73
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Somewhat.

74
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,168
You know what they say,

75
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:42,436
it's not a trip
to the Big Apple

76
00:08:42,503 --> 00:08:43,904
without a walking tour
of the city.

77
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:45,406
Have you ever done one?

78
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:46,941
They're very well-reviewed,
actually, mine are.

79
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:48,744
It's a great deal, great offer.

80
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:50,446
I'm not a guest.

81
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:53,582
Then, pray tell,
why do you have a suitcase?

82
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:56,217
I'm here to interview for one
of the temporary positions.

83
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:58,653
Because of the wedding.

84
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,989
What wedding?

85
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:03,358
Preeta and Ben.

86
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:06,462
Ah. As in, like,
the Preeta and Ben?

87
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:08,663
New York society's
favorite couple.

88
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:10,065
It's going to be
quite the event.

89
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,767
Huh.

90
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,268
The hotel is hiring?

91
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:16,137
Yes, but they're
very exclusive.

92
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:18,806
They certainly wouldn't
hire you.

93
00:09:18,873 --> 00:09:20,008
Mm.

94
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:23,412
And what did you say
your name was again?

95
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:25,547
Linda Perrybottom.

96
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:26,849
Linda Perrybottom,

97
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,318
unfortunately,
you just failed the test.

98
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:30,351
What?

99
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:31,852
Your interview
started the minute

100
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,121
that you walked in the door.

101
00:09:33,187 --> 00:09:34,355
I didn't realize, I just...

102
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:35,989
Employees
of the Royal Gate Hotel

103
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:38,192
must be accommodating,
masterly,

104
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:40,329
but above all, Linda,

105
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:41,430
discreet.

106
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,665
If they're telling
a perfect stranger

107
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:45,166
the intimate details

108
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,634
of the inner workings of
this hotel's private events,

109
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:49,336
well, that doesn't
quite cut it now, does it?

110
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:51,605
- I'd...
- May I see your resume?

111
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:53,408
- Please?
- Uh...

112
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:54,810
Yes, of course.

113
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,076
Thank you.

114
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:59,114
Oh, wow.

115
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,749
Yeah, you've had
a lot of really cool jobs.

116
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:01,883
Yes, I have.

117
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,518
- The Dorsey?
- Dorsey.

118
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:05,821
The Armada.

119
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:07,756
These all are hotels?

120
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:09,990
Well, none are in New York.
I just moved here from London.

121
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:11,359
Listen, Linda.

122
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:12,393
I don't think you're right
for this weekend.

123
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,761
Oh.

124
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:17,132
We just need someone more...

125
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:20,268
local.

126
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:25,474
Well, I understand.

127
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,710
Thank you for the opportunity.

128
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:38,453
Hi. If I wanted to apply

129
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,254
for a temporary position
for this weekend...

130
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:41,556
Is this your resume?

131
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:42,991
- No, it's not.
- Wow, this is impressive.

132
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:46,527
My only... copy.

133
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:49,263
Well, you are definitely
gonna get hired.

134
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,733
In fact, I'm gonna
call them right now.

135
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:51,899
Right now?

136
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:53,734
Yeah.

137
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:56,403
- Lola...
- Mm-hmm?

138
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,642
if I wanted to shop for,
say, a jacket...

139
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:02,777
Uh, yeah, sure.
Just to the left over there.

140
00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:04,313
Thank you so much.

141
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:06,214
Hi, yeah, we have

142
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:08,816
a very lovely young lady
down at the front desk.

143
00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:10,451
Uh, she's going to be...

144
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:36,945
Well, well, well.

145
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,512
Look at what we got here.

146
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,215
You know,
if I wasn't a betting cat,

147
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:41,482
I'd say Tommy boy here

148
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:43,018
is trying to break
into the hotel.

149
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:44,352
That's sure what it looks like.

150
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:45,787
This here is our alley,
punk!

151
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:47,355
Which makes this our hotel!

152
00:11:47,422 --> 00:11:48,623
Wait, hold up.

153
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,492
Are you trying
to break into our hotel?

154
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:52,192
Yo, guys, don't worry about it.

155
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:53,894
It was a big misunderstanding.

156
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:55,330
Right, Tom?

157
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:56,998
Are you laughing at me?

158
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:59,667
Now, I'm sure you know what
I do to cats that laugh at me.

159
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:01,703
Come on, boss!
Preach! Preach to him!

160
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:04,672
Now, I was about to,
if you would shut that grill

161
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:05,706
and let me handle this.

162
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:07,109
My bad, boss.

163
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:08,475
So, are you gonna answer me?

164
00:12:10,378 --> 00:12:12,047
Oh, snap!
It's five-o! Drop and run!

165
00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:14,616
- Oh, no, not again!
- Somebody pick me up,

166
00:12:14,682 --> 00:12:16,484
- I can't run that fast!
- Hey, I'll see you again, Tom!

167
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:17,585
- Break yourself!
- Hey, get back here!

168
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:21,356
Phew!

169
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:31,532
Oh, yeah!

170
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:48,782
Welcome.

171
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,984
Thank you so much.

172
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:51,720
- You must be...
- Hi. <i>Buongiorno.</i>

173
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:54,089
Forester, Kayla.

174
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:56,758
I'm sorry in advance
about my resume,

175
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:58,893
but there was
a child downstairs

176
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,163
trying to spit their
Hubba Bubba under a table.

177
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:04,398
So I tore off a piece.

178
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:09,137
Good. I'm Terence Mendoza,
Events Manager.

179
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:11,106
And this is Mr. Henry Dubros.

180
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:12,273
- Hi.
- A pleasure.

181
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,609
He's our general manager.

182
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,578
And I assume that that's
the aquatics manager?

183
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:20,547
That's Goldie.

184
00:13:20,614 --> 00:13:22,984
She has no official position
at the hotel. That's a fish.

185
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:25,387
That's the...

186
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:28,524
I must say, this is
a very impressive resume.

187
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:30,191
The Dorsey?

188
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:32,360
Oh. The Dorsey.

189
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:33,894
You know, I hate to name names,

190
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:35,596
but, uh, I will.

191
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:39,133
You must have known
Mrs. Josephine Pennybaker.

192
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,069
She was my mentor at Cornell.

193
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,369
It's an Ivy League school

194
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:44,373
founded in 1865
by Mr. Ezra Cornell.

195
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:45,941
That's where I got my master's.

196
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:48,343
I'm just sharing.

197
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:50,978
Of course I know
old Jojo Pennyfoot.

198
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:52,246
Yeah. What a hoot.

199
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:53,681
Pennyfoot?

200
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:55,816
Well, Miss Forester,
we'll cut to the chase.

201
00:13:55,883 --> 00:13:57,219
As I'm sure you know,

202
00:13:57,284 --> 00:13:58,919
we have
a very high-profile event

203
00:13:58,986 --> 00:14:00,454
happening here this weekend.

204
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:03,023
Of course, I'm very aware
of Ben and Preeta's wedding.

205
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,594
Well, we need to hire additional
staff through the week.

206
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:08,162
But they must maintain
the level of service

207
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:09,696
guests of
the Royal Gate expect.

208
00:14:09,763 --> 00:14:11,566
- Nonetheless.
- And I'll be honest,

209
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:14,302
it's not often we come across
a resume this distinguished.

210
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:16,303
Excuse me,

211
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,607
but this, this is just
a piece of paper.

212
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:22,310
If I'm gonna be worthy
of this institution,

213
00:14:22,377 --> 00:14:24,680
you need to see me in...

214
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:29,484
action.

215
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:32,687
Are you gonna pick it up
or just leave it there?

216
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:34,956
Yes, sir.

217
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:38,359
Put it in the bin.

218
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:44,065
Terence.

219
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:44,965
She thought the fish
was the head of the department.

220
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:46,268
Really?

221
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,134
A fish can't even walk.
It can't even...

222
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:49,503
Terence.

223
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:52,639
You're hired.

224
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:54,408
- Really?
- Yes.

225
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:57,077
I mean, thank you.

226
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:58,111
Can you start today?

227
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:02,250
That's gonna be a tall order.

228
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:05,286
Mm... Very in demand.

229
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:07,455
Okay. Yeah, you know what?

230
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:08,790
I'm gonna pull some strings.

231
00:15:08,856 --> 00:15:10,658
It's difficult,
but, yeah, no problem.

232
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:11,859
One other thing.

233
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:13,860
Uh, we will be asking
all temporary staff

234
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:14,995
to stay at the hotel

235
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:16,664
through the week
leading up to the wedding.

236
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,499
Uh, just so that we can be
available to guests

237
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:19,868
at a moment's notice.

238
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:20,935
Is that something
you'd be comfortable with?

239
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:24,338
Anything for this hotel.

240
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:33,715
No, it's better down.

241
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:37,051
10-4, good buddy.
Breaker, breaker, 1-9.

242
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:41,588
Go get 'em.

243
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:44,459
Hair's better up.
It's more professional.

244
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:47,296
Good morning.

245
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:50,699
Good morning, sir.

246
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:55,169
<i>The Royal Gate
opened its doors in 1930</i>

247
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:57,037
and was declared
a New York City landmark

248
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:58,706
- by 1962.
- Mm.

249
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:00,607
It's been through
two major renovations,

250
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:03,712
yet it remains the beacon
of service excellence.

251
00:16:04,946 --> 00:16:06,913
This place has been host
to four presidents,

252
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,750
three popes, two kings,
one queen,

253
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:11,452
oh, and Drake.

254
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:16,624
<i>There are 260 rooms,</i>

255
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:19,726
<i>104 suites, and 21 floors
of impeccable luxury.</i>

256
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:22,162
<i>The water pressure
is never below 50 PSI,</i>

257
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:24,431
<i>and our thread count
is never below 800.</i>

258
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:27,235
- Button, please.
- Sorry, sir.

259
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:28,970
The spa is
top-of-the-line,

260
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:32,172
<i>and our spin instructor won
the Tour de France. Twice.</i>

261
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,874
<i>Right.</i>

262
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:35,143
<i>This wedding
is the most prestigious event</i>

263
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,377
<i>the Royal Gate has hosted.</i>

264
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:37,411
And it will be
a perfect success.

265
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:39,080
It has to be.

266
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:42,182
The positive press an event
of this magnitude can generate

267
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:43,684
is invaluable.

268
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,220
Would you stop that, please?

269
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:46,921
- The... Yeah, sir.
- Okay.

270
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:49,725
Yes. It's just,
it tends to ride up.

271
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:53,561
<i>Our wedding menu
is being designed</i>

272
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:55,296
<i>by our very own Chef Jackie.</i>

273
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:56,597
<i>He's a rising star,</i>

274
00:16:56,663 --> 00:16:59,133
and whispers are
that Michelin agrees.

275
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Hector!

276
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:01,469
Hector!

277
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:03,405
Look alive, people.

278
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:05,974
Why do you hate me?

279
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,676
Who butchered these onions?
Who?

280
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:10,912
Oh, I don't know. Francois?

281
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:13,480
- We should leave.
- You're killing my career!

282
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:15,717
He's a bit tricky,
but he's an artist.

283
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:17,051
And we're lucky to have him.

284
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:19,119
<i>And some people
may see anger, but me?</i>

285
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:21,923
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.
I see passion.</i>

286
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,191
Do you hear that?

287
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:24,926
- Hear what?
- Your footsteps.

288
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:26,561
- Oh.
- Carrara marble.

289
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:30,064
This is Gavin, our doorman.

290
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,332
Master of small talk.

291
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:33,834
This is Kayla,
who recently worked

292
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:36,203
at the Dorsey Hotel in London.

293
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:37,738
Did she now?

294
00:17:37,804 --> 00:17:39,506
Yes. And she'll be
helping us out this week.

295
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:42,510
Mm. I'm sure you'll
knock 'em dead, Kayla.

296
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:45,946
Morning!

297
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:48,882
That's Joy, the bell girl.

298
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:50,717
I'm convinced
she was raised by wolves.

299
00:17:50,784 --> 00:17:51,518
- What?
- She's not important.

300
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:52,620
Okay.

301
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:54,622
But this glass atrium.

302
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:56,690
Oh, wow. Now that is something.

303
00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:58,258
It's one of a kind.

304
00:17:58,326 --> 00:18:02,831
I call it the "crowning jewel
of the Royal Gate."

305
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:08,670
This is Cameron, the barman.

306
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:12,107
Popping bottles.

307
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:13,607
Excuse me?

308
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:16,010
Don't spill any
on your Jordan 5s.

309
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:17,813
These are actually
retro reissues.

310
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:21,215
Obviously, it's the lace tips.

311
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:22,350
- NikeLab?
- Flight Club.

312
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:23,984
On Broadway.

313
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:26,687
I'm sorry to interrupt
your riveting TED Talk,

314
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:28,356
but why are you
pouring champagne

315
00:18:28,423 --> 00:18:29,524
at 11 o'clock in the morning?

316
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,824
I was told to pour two glasses

317
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,994
for the VIPs that just arrived.

318
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:34,061
They're here?

319
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:35,529
- Yes, sir.
- Who's here?

320
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:36,798
The bride and groom.
Come with me.

321
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:51,012
Wow!

322
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:52,879
- Isn't it perfect?
- I love it.

323
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:55,015
Just as much as I did
last week when we visited.

324
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:57,651
All I care about
in the whole world

325
00:18:57,717 --> 00:18:58,887
is that you're happy.

326
00:19:00,888 --> 00:19:02,122
Think your dad's gonna like it?

327
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:04,225
You keep asking
what my dad thinks,

328
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:06,761
I'm gonna send him
on the honeymoon with you.

329
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:09,230
Clear the way,
coming through.

330
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:11,665
I sure hope room service
is open all night.

331
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,201
Right, Toots?

332
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,442
Ben, Preeta, welcome back
to the Royal Gate.

333
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,945
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

334
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:25,846
It's a toast
to your upcoming nuptials.

335
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:27,949
It's so great to be back here.
Thank you very much.

336
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:29,450
- Appreciate it.
- Absolutely.

337
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:30,684
And thank you guys
for everything.

338
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,186
It's great to see you again,
Terence.

339
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:32,854
- Thank you very much.
- Mouse!

340
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:36,391
Oh, my God!
Spike, get back here!

341
00:19:36,457 --> 00:19:37,859
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh, my gosh!

342
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,926
Simmer down, boy! Hey!
Get back here!

343
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:41,794
- I'm so sorry.
- It's no problem.

344
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:43,163
Sorry.

345
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,766
- A little jumpy, huh?
- Ooh.

346
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:47,034
I'm sorry,
he's a little animated.

347
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:48,369
Yeah, um...

348
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:49,904
Oh, she's so sweet.

349
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:52,373
Wow, you're really good
with animals.

350
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:55,609
Toots is usually really shy.
And by "shy," I mean,

351
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:57,645
she... She scratches
people's faces off.

352
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:59,747
- Oh.
- Oh. Well...

353
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:02,248
she can smell
a bona fide animal lover.

354
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:05,019
You know,
Kayla's new here

355
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:06,487
and I was just about
to explain to her that, uh...

356
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:09,791
we traditionally
have a no-pets policy...

357
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:11,492
- Oh, wow.
- ...but, uh, you know...

358
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:15,763
I would be delighted
to make an exception.

359
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,497
- Is your hand okay?
- It's fine.

360
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:18,899
Looks like
your hand's bleeding.

361
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:20,301
It's fine, it's perfect.
We've prepared a list

362
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:22,102
of some of the most
prestigious dog parks

363
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:23,403
in the area, and I think

364
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:26,474
the one on 11th Street
is particularly luxurious.

365
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,875
But are the people uptight?

366
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:29,810
Because... I mean,
do they yell at the dogs

367
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,378
for being off-leash?

368
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:33,548
- Spike, he's... he's... Yeah.
- You can just say it.

369
00:20:33,613 --> 00:20:34,914
- He's disgusting.
- Yeah.

370
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:36,517
- He's disgusting?
- Huh?

371
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,918
There is one that I know about

372
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:39,587
that's behind
this falafel place on 17th.

373
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:40,821
It's not technically
a dog park,

374
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:42,089
but they let
their dogs off-leash

375
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:43,389
and they kinda
look out for each other.

376
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:44,524
It's pretty low-key.

377
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:45,893
That is amazing.
Thank you, Kayla.

378
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:48,128
- Thanks, Kayla.
- Yes. Thank you, Kayla.

379
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:50,430
Of course. Any time.

380
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:53,600
I just have to say, I follow
you guys on Instagram,

381
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:56,536
and you are
the cutest couple ever.

382
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,907
And that rock, whoa!

383
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:00,708
- Yes, well...
- Yeah.

384
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:04,244
Could see that thing
from outer space. Good job.

385
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:06,546
You know, you could see
our love from outer space.

386
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:07,780
Oh.

387
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:09,116
That was fantastic.

388
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:10,685
- Great. Thank you.
- Shall we?

389
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:12,086
- We shall.
- Come on, Tootsie.

390
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:13,987
Come on, Spike.

391
00:21:14,054 --> 00:21:15,355
But in all seriousness,
is there a safe in the hotel?

392
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:16,857
It's a giant diamond.

393
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:18,259
Of course, of course.

394
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:30,637
How was the ride?

395
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:31,740
Very good,
thank you very much.

396
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:38,146
Not... Not to worry.

397
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,181
That's probably
a scream of delight.

398
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:41,749
You know, someone seeing
their beautiful room

399
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:43,083
for the first time.
It happens all the time.

400
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,985
Lola? Can you see them
to their room?

401
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:46,855
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

402
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,256
Leo is shaken to the core.

403
00:21:49,323 --> 00:21:50,757
The mouse

404
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:53,494
ran right over his foot.

405
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:55,929
Look, Terence,
I've worked too frigging hard

406
00:21:55,996 --> 00:21:58,331
to be saddled
with a bunch of inept...

407
00:21:58,398 --> 00:22:02,802
Wonderful group of gifted
colleagues to have my career

408
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:06,674
tossed into a fish bucket
over some infestation.

409
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:08,743
Jackie,
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie.

410
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,178
I know the gravity
of this situation.

411
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:13,947
- And I will handle it.
- I'll catch it, sir.

412
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:17,584
Him. Or her.

413
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:18,985
It could be a female...

414
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:21,022
- I'm not gender biased
- No, no.

415
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,923
- and I don't want to go by...
- No, no, it's fine. It's gender-fluid now.

416
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,294
The point is, I will catch
that little mouse,

417
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,528
and I will be
discreet about it.

418
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:40,841
Okay. I need you to understand

419
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:42,475
the sensitivity of this matter.

420
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:45,112
- Yes.
- If a picture of this mouse is tweeted up

421
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,316
to insta-book-face
or the ticky-tock,

422
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:50,751
we will be ruined.

423
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:52,920
No, sir. We're not ruined,
because it's not gonna happen.

424
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:54,854
Okay? So, you guys
clear your heads about it.

425
00:22:54,921 --> 00:22:56,490
That Rodentia is toast.

426
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:25,887
What are you doing?

427
00:23:28,223 --> 00:23:29,791
Oh, my gosh, you scared me.

428
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:32,192
I scared you?

429
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:34,228
You know, you're the one
creeping around like a thief.

430
00:23:34,294 --> 00:23:37,098
I am on a mouse hunt.
Thank you.

431
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,465
Need any help?

432
00:23:38,532 --> 00:23:41,970
What? Because I'm...
I'm... I'm the new girl?

433
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:46,306
Well, obviously,
you haven't seen my resume.

434
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:48,975
It clearly states that
I am completely capable

435
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:51,277
of doing anything
that is required

436
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:54,347
to do that is needed
to be done here.

437
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:55,550
Oh, right.

438
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:58,452
And how hard can it be
to catch a little mouse?

439
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:00,822
Honestly, I wasn't
expecting you to say yes.

440
00:24:00,888 --> 00:24:02,055
You know, you got that whole

441
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:03,690
independent vibe thing
going on,

442
00:24:03,757 --> 00:24:05,091
and I don't
normally get involved

443
00:24:05,158 --> 00:24:06,960
with how the new kids
do their jobs. So...

444
00:24:07,026 --> 00:24:08,929
My name, um... My name is

445
00:24:08,996 --> 00:24:10,564
Kayla. Yeah.

446
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,898
My mom calls me Kayla.

447
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:13,667
Oh, okay, Kayla.

448
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:17,003
Well, I doubt that mouse
catching is on your resume,

449
00:24:17,071 --> 00:24:18,473
but if you do catch him,

450
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,942
you should come by
for a celebratory beverage.

451
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:23,844
Well, start popping another
bottle of champagne now,

452
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,849
because any minute now,
he's mine.

453
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:31,452
He's... One second.

454
00:24:34,054 --> 00:24:35,156
What the...

455
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,060
Did someone leave their...

456
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:43,330
What is that?

457
00:24:44,532 --> 00:24:46,600
The sign
of a worthy competitor.

458
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:21,401
Guess who's at the party?

459
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:25,472
Come on, man.
Have some self-respect.

460
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:26,540
You are in a dumpster

461
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:28,743
and Jerry's inside,
safe and warm.

462
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,377
Look at him.

463
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:32,378
Just scouting the room and
seeing what he can steal next.

464
00:25:32,446 --> 00:25:34,247
Now, who's the cat
and who's the mouse?

465
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:36,883
Hey, let's get back in there
and smash that mouse up good.

466
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:39,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tom, my brother,

467
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:41,689
there's room for both cats
and mice to be happy.

468
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:44,190
Look, I'm sure if you asked
to share his food...

469
00:25:44,257 --> 00:25:46,593
Share? You're lucky
the kids are watching, okay?

470
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:48,061
We're cats. Cats take!

471
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:50,630
Come on, he's just
an innocent little mouse.

472
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:53,266
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Why're we always arguing?

473
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:55,068
We shouldn't be fighting,
we look alike.

474
00:25:55,135 --> 00:25:56,637
Why are we doing this?

475
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:58,339
Look, how about we do
something different this time?

476
00:25:58,406 --> 00:26:00,941
Why don't we let Tom
make up his own mind, okay?

477
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:03,009
Now, see, that is a good idea.

478
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:04,479
Tom, I believe in you.

479
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:08,782
What a sucker.

480
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:10,385
Now go make me proud, Tom.

481
00:26:31,738 --> 00:26:32,606
Whoa!

482
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:10,010
Ahhh!

483
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:03,398
<i>Life, do you hear me?</i>

484
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:07,667
<i>Give my creation life!</i>

485
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,628
<i>Launch the third swing!</i>

486
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:48,142
<i>...my creation life!</i>

487
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:22,275
Go for Lone Wolf.

488
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:23,811
<i>Who?</i>

489
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:25,778
It's Kayla, sir.

490
00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:28,015
Just trying on one of
those new code names.

491
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,081
Well, don't.

492
00:29:29,148 --> 00:29:30,350
Have you located the room yet?

493
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:31,752
I'm continuing
to get noise complaints.

494
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:33,921
Yes, sir...
Well, no, sir, I haven't yet,

495
00:29:33,987 --> 00:29:35,721
but I'm... I'm on it. Over.

496
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:37,991
<i>Well, hurry up so you can get
back to finding that mouse.</i>

497
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:41,094
And please, do not say "over."
This isn't <i>Star Trek.</i>

498
00:29:42,463 --> 00:29:43,965
Takes all the fun
out of walkie-talkies.

499
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:45,566
I mean, what's the point, then?

500
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:47,266
<i>I can still hear you.</i>

501
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:56,910
I have eyes on the target,
sir, and I am moving north...

502
00:29:56,977 --> 00:29:58,411
I'm moving toward the door.

503
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:08,589
Oh, no.

504
00:30:09,357 --> 00:30:10,458
What did you do?

505
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:16,497
Who...

506
00:30:17,263 --> 00:30:18,799
Wait a second, I know you.

507
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:21,468
I know you! You're the cat
from the park with the bike

508
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:23,236
and you tackled me.

509
00:30:23,302 --> 00:30:24,771
Is this personal?

510
00:30:24,838 --> 00:30:28,709
Is this some form
of revenge sabotage?

511
00:30:28,774 --> 00:30:31,211
What are you... You're trying
to tell me something?

512
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:34,747
Okay. Two syllables.

513
00:30:34,814 --> 00:30:36,716
One word. Is it a movie?

514
00:30:36,783 --> 00:30:38,319
Is it a cartoon?

515
00:30:39,485 --> 00:30:40,821
What's this? A pig?

516
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,359
A mouse?

517
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:48,028
A little mouse?

518
00:30:48,094 --> 00:30:49,829
What? He was here, too?

519
00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:52,599
Gosh, I gotta catch
that little disaster.

520
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,402
If I don't,
I'm gonna lose this job.

521
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:57,237
Wait a second.

522
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,406
You're a cat.

523
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:02,509
Can't you catch a mouse?
Isn't that in your DNA?

524
00:31:05,111 --> 00:31:05,979
Huh.

525
00:31:07,914 --> 00:31:08,916
You got a name?

526
00:31:13,553 --> 00:31:16,357
That is really well done, Mot.

527
00:31:19,192 --> 00:31:20,527
Tom?

528
00:31:20,593 --> 00:31:22,662
You could be
in a lot of trouble for this.

529
00:31:22,728 --> 00:31:25,131
I mean, just look at this mess.

530
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:28,735
So, what should we do
about this?

531
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:30,638
You wanna catch
a mouse together?

532
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,673
There could be
a big reward in it for you.

533
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,584
Sir, I instructed her

534
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,719
to get rid of an animal,
not find another.

535
00:31:46,785 --> 00:31:48,321
Here's how I see it, sir.

536
00:31:48,388 --> 00:31:51,123
We have a mouse problem
at this hotel,

537
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,359
so we could hire
an exterminator

538
00:31:53,426 --> 00:31:56,097
to have him tramp up and down
this whole hotel,

539
00:31:56,163 --> 00:31:59,032
just filling it with his poison

540
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,434
and alerting Ben and Preeta

541
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,436
to the possibility of vermin
at their wedding,

542
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:06,572
or we could leverage
millions of years

543
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:08,975
of predatory-prey evolution

544
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:11,544
and choose a more

545
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,748
subtle and eco-friendly
solution.

546
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:19,352
That's why I brought on Tom.

547
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,522
You brought on...

548
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:24,157
She's a temp. She doesn't
even have hiring power.

549
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:25,658
It's what we did
at the Dorsey, sir.

550
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:26,760
Really?

551
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:28,428
That is not what they did
at the Dorsey.

552
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:30,097
Why don't I ask
Mrs. Pennybaker?

553
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:31,299
Who...

554
00:32:32,165 --> 00:32:34,167
wouldn't want you to ask

555
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:35,703
Mrs. Pennybaker
from the Dorsey?

556
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,503
Why don't I call her
right now, huh?

557
00:32:37,571 --> 00:32:39,939
Absolutely not.
No one's calling anyone.

558
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:42,508
Word gets out that we're
thinking of hiring a cat,

559
00:32:42,576 --> 00:32:44,178
well, the mouse problem
could leak.

560
00:32:44,244 --> 00:32:46,580
And if word gets out that
we're refusing to hire a cat,

561
00:32:46,647 --> 00:32:48,349
PETA will be here
before you can say

562
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:49,350
"discriminatory practices."

563
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:50,650
Mm-hmm.

564
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:52,485
You need to think
outside the box, Terence.

565
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:54,821
Could he wear a hat?

566
00:32:56,423 --> 00:32:57,391
Excuse me, sir?

567
00:32:57,457 --> 00:32:59,025
Could he wear a jaunty hat?

568
00:32:59,092 --> 00:33:01,094
And, uh, perhaps a name tag?

569
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:02,328
I think that'd be adorable.

570
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:03,597
One second.

571
00:33:04,764 --> 00:33:08,068
Sir, you, you can't be serious?
A hat?

572
00:33:08,135 --> 00:33:12,106
As you can see,
he would love to wear a hat.

573
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:13,906
And a name tag.

574
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:17,244
Well, then I think this is a
creative and elegant solve, Kayla.

575
00:33:17,311 --> 00:33:19,679
Thank you, sir. As do I.

576
00:33:19,746 --> 00:33:21,448
That'll be all.
Thank you.

577
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:48,041
You gotta fix your name tag.

578
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:48,975
There you go.

579
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:51,077
Yeah.

580
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:53,346
You look good.

581
00:33:53,414 --> 00:33:54,815
I figured out who you are.

582
00:33:57,451 --> 00:33:58,619
Who am I?

583
00:33:58,686 --> 00:33:59,953
You're one of
those millennials.

584
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,488
that thinks they can get
whatever they want

585
00:34:01,554 --> 00:34:02,455
whenever they want

586
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:04,124
without working for it,

587
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,159
preferably with free shipping.

588
00:34:07,927 --> 00:34:10,663
Who doesn't
like free shipping?

589
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,834
This is a cutthroat
$200 billion industry.

590
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:18,438
And I've clawed my way
all the way to the middle.

591
00:34:18,505 --> 00:34:20,107
And I don't intend
on stopping there.

592
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,907
Okay?

593
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:24,210
You better hope
this little cat plan works.

594
00:34:24,277 --> 00:34:25,845
Because if it doesn't,

595
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:27,848
I'll make sure you'll never
work in New York City again.

596
00:34:29,516 --> 00:34:32,652
And that goes for you, too,
Tom. Yes, you.

597
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,587
Enjoy it
while it lasts because...

598
00:34:40,692 --> 00:34:41,794
This is just a test, Tom.

599
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,031
Uh-uh.

600
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,198
He doesn't think
that we can do it.

601
00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:48,869
Just like most people I know.

602
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:52,138
But you and I,
we're different, Tom.

603
00:34:52,205 --> 00:34:53,574
We don't go down easy.

604
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,577
All right,
I'm gonna start in the lobby.

605
00:34:58,244 --> 00:34:59,112
Tom?

606
00:35:15,228 --> 00:35:17,164
Okay. All right. You done?

607
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,232
Ahhh!

608
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:22,169
Mm?

609
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:28,774
Listen here, kitty-cat,

610
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:30,944
I don't like being pounded.
Capiche?

611
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:33,013
I see you again,
I bash your head in.

612
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,380
Spike, get back here.

613
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:39,653
Saw you again!

614
00:36:11,284 --> 00:36:12,152
Toots.

615
00:36:14,888 --> 00:36:16,556
There you are, girl.

616
00:36:16,623 --> 00:36:17,657
What were you doing?

617
00:36:17,723 --> 00:36:19,525
I was looking all over for you.

618
00:36:19,592 --> 00:36:20,694
Whew!

619
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:24,764
Tom, what are you doing
in the lobby?

620
00:36:26,232 --> 00:36:28,467
Oh!

621
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:31,337
I see you becoming the hunter...

622
00:36:31,404 --> 00:36:33,840
feeling the hunted.

623
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:38,578
Yeah, there we go.

624
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:39,947
Tracking the trail.

625
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:42,882
Yeah, you smell
those little paws. Yep.

626
00:36:43,817 --> 00:36:45,619
My gosh, Tom.

627
00:36:45,685 --> 00:36:48,388
I mean, be the predator. Yeah.

628
00:36:48,455 --> 00:36:50,456
Oh.

629
00:36:50,523 --> 00:36:52,157
Okay, why are you...

630
00:36:52,225 --> 00:36:54,060
You're drawing a...

631
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:56,297
Look, I...

632
00:36:56,362 --> 00:36:59,565
Oh. Tom, that is
a "wanted dead or alive..."

633
00:36:59,632 --> 00:37:01,533
That is a stick figure
of a mouse

634
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:02,869
and your Es are backwards.

635
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:04,337
That's never gonna work.

636
00:37:04,404 --> 00:37:06,206
- You're looking for a mouse?
- Gosh! Hi.

637
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:09,475
Yes, Joy. Yeah.

638
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,911
Well, have you checked the tiny
little door on the 10th floor?

639
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:19,918
At first, I thought, "Whoa, Joy, you
became really big. When did that happen?"

640
00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:21,487
But then I saw another door
that was normal sized

641
00:37:21,554 --> 00:37:23,389
and thought, "Okay, so one of
your eyeballs got small."

642
00:37:23,456 --> 00:37:25,157
- But then I blinked a ton
- Yeah.

643
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:27,293
and realized, "No, Joy,
just this door was really small."

644
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,697
So, I cut up a towel to make tiny
little towels and left them here.

645
00:37:30,697 --> 00:37:32,332
But now they're gone.

646
00:37:36,203 --> 00:37:39,839
Thank you, Joy. You are
a fascinating creature.

647
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:41,808
Hmm.

648
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:44,378
Me, fascinating? I like that.

649
00:37:52,685 --> 00:37:54,386
Listen here, punk.

650
00:37:54,453 --> 00:37:55,621
You and I gotta chat...

651
00:38:02,096 --> 00:38:03,496
What?

652
00:38:03,563 --> 00:38:05,065
You want me to grab it?

653
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:07,267
Thank you.

654
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:10,703
Oh, wow. This is so detailed.

655
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,107
What kind of
tiny printer or...

656
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:15,442
And it's scented?

657
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:16,744
What the...

658
00:38:18,377 --> 00:38:20,580
Listen here, Mr. Mouse.

659
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:22,116
Oh. Jerry.

660
00:38:22,782 --> 00:38:24,083
I need this job.

661
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,020
So, simply put, this is a hotel

662
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:29,289
and you're a mouse. So,

663
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,058
you gotta go.

664
00:38:32,826 --> 00:38:34,994
Well, if that's how
you feel about it,

665
00:38:35,061 --> 00:38:38,232
I'll have to introduce you
to my enforcer.

666
00:38:53,346 --> 00:38:55,916
Oh!

667
00:38:56,482 --> 00:38:58,349
Oh, my gosh!

668
00:38:58,384 --> 00:38:59,953
Oh.

669
00:39:04,257 --> 00:39:05,125
No!

670
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:08,862
Oh.

671
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:14,501
You do not get to beat up
my enforcer!

672
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:15,634
Open up the door!

673
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:16,770
Open up!

674
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:21,107
Let me in!

675
00:39:21,174 --> 00:39:22,341
- <i>Kayla!</i>
- Argh!

676
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:25,946
What do you need,
sir?

677
00:39:26,013 --> 00:39:27,681
<i>Meet me in the bridal suite
immediately.</i>

678
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:28,916
Right away, sir.

679
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:33,520
You figure out a solution

680
00:39:33,587 --> 00:39:35,956
to get that mouse out of here.

681
00:39:49,302 --> 00:39:51,371
Uh, come on in.

682
00:39:52,538 --> 00:39:53,839
Hey, guys.

683
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:56,810
Sorry, it's sort of

684
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:59,211
the wedding situation room
up here.

685
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:00,179
Wow.

686
00:40:00,246 --> 00:40:01,381
Ah!

687
00:40:01,447 --> 00:40:03,215
Terence, you were right.
This simulator's amazing.

688
00:40:03,282 --> 00:40:05,786
- Ah!
- It really replicates how bad I am at golf.

689
00:40:05,851 --> 00:40:07,319
Oh, I see that.

690
00:40:07,386 --> 00:40:08,921
I haven't seen this many
shanks since I was in prison.

691
00:40:08,987 --> 00:40:10,857
White-collar crime, but, uh...

692
00:40:10,924 --> 00:40:13,126
Baby, do you wanna
maybe take a little break?

693
00:40:13,192 --> 00:40:14,895
Or if you wanna
do something together,

694
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,229
we can go
scuba diving in Tahiti.

695
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:19,800
We, uh, could go
hang gliding in the Alps.

696
00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:22,869
Or, uh, we could go
to this alien planet

697
00:40:22,935 --> 00:40:24,971
and just sort of,
uh, shoot some aliens.

698
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:26,873
Kayla, you could
just put those down. Sorry.

699
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,008
- Where? Here?
- Just right behind you.

700
00:40:28,074 --> 00:40:29,542
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

701
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:31,578
Terence, actually, could I
grab that one from you?

702
00:40:31,643 --> 00:40:32,911
Ah, good. It's heavy.

703
00:40:32,978 --> 00:40:34,647
Think this might be it.

704
00:40:34,714 --> 00:40:37,451
Just a little bit of a
surprise for me and the Mrs.

705
00:40:37,516 --> 00:40:39,351
Let's see.

706
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:41,455
By the way, while I have you,
Terence, um,

707
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,122
- could I ask you a question?
- Absolutely.

708
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,424
What do you think
about elephants?

709
00:40:44,491 --> 00:40:47,159
Um... Elephants.

710
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:50,596
I think they are majestic
and noble creatures.

711
00:40:50,663 --> 00:40:51,897
No, I mean for the wedding.

712
00:40:51,964 --> 00:40:53,199
Oh, at the wedding?
Real elephants?

713
00:40:53,266 --> 00:40:55,033
Yeah, I sort of thought
it might be fun.

714
00:40:55,101 --> 00:40:57,103
Babe, I never said
that they wouldn't be fun.

715
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,671
Oh...

716
00:40:58,737 --> 00:41:00,873
So, uh, maybe, you know...

717
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,776
Maybe we'll do elephants.
Maybe we do elephants.

718
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:05,545
Have you, um,

719
00:41:05,612 --> 00:41:08,748
considered maybe
a smaller animal like a...

720
00:41:08,815 --> 00:41:10,483
- like a hamster?
- Hamster?

721
00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:12,185
- Oh. That's cute.
- Yeah.

722
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:13,587
We were gonna
ride in on it, though.

723
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:15,322
Can, can you ride a hamster?

724
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,957
Oh, yes. I mean, as long
as you have enough of them,

725
00:41:18,023 --> 00:41:19,225
- you can ride them silly.
- Yes.

726
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:21,127
Great. Yeah.

727
00:41:21,194 --> 00:41:23,029
Well, that's something
to consider, too.

728
00:41:23,096 --> 00:41:25,431
Babe, if getting elephants
at the wedding

729
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:26,532
would make you happy...

730
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,835
You being happy
would make me happy.

731
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,370
Aw!

732
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:32,539
Okay, get the elephants.

733
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:33,973
All right!
We're gonna get the elephants.

734
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,342
Great! We'll do the elephants!

735
00:41:36,976 --> 00:41:38,311
Boom.

736
00:41:38,377 --> 00:41:41,046
Oh! It's a motorized
skateboard. I love those.

737
00:41:41,114 --> 00:41:43,215
It's got, uh, you know, Wi-Fi.

738
00:41:43,282 --> 00:41:45,851
Why does a skateboard
need Wi-Fi?

739
00:41:45,918 --> 00:41:47,387
Why the fi not?

740
00:41:47,453 --> 00:41:48,888
"Why the fi not?"

741
00:41:48,956 --> 00:41:49,990
See what I'm dealing with?

742
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:52,192
Oh.

743
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,860
Hello? Hey.

744
00:41:53,927 --> 00:41:56,529
- Yeah, uh, he's right here.
- Who is it?

745
00:41:56,596 --> 00:41:57,496
My dad.

746
00:41:57,563 --> 00:41:58,865
What? Do I look okay?

747
00:41:58,931 --> 00:42:00,067
For a phone call? Yes.

748
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,701
Right.

749
00:42:01,768 --> 00:42:04,637
One second. Phew.

750
00:42:04,703 --> 00:42:05,971
Hello, Mr. Mehta.

751
00:42:06,038 --> 00:42:07,540
You sound like
you look amazing.

752
00:42:08,507 --> 00:42:10,176
Uh-huh?

753
00:42:10,243 --> 00:42:12,011
- If you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to call.
- Yeah.

754
00:42:12,078 --> 00:42:13,979
We'll help you accordingly.

755
00:42:14,047 --> 00:42:16,016
You know what, Terence,

756
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:17,684
Spike got into some burritos

757
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,850
- earlier and, well...
- Huh?

758
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:21,488
I was, you know. Do you mind?

759
00:42:22,855 --> 00:42:24,724
Um... Of course.

760
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:27,493
I'm ready! I'm ready!

761
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,328
Thank you.

762
00:42:28,395 --> 00:42:30,297
Kayla, can you...

763
00:42:30,362 --> 00:42:32,799
Uh, actually,
I would love to keep Kayla

764
00:42:32,864 --> 00:42:34,100
and maybe run through

765
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:36,469
some bridesmaids-related stuff
with her.

766
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:38,638
- You know, coordinating colors.
- Sure.

767
00:42:38,705 --> 00:42:40,273
I have a very good eye.

768
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:42,308
No, that's fine. I'll just
run through it all with Kayla.

769
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,380
Here we go. I got the lead.
I got the lead. Come on.

770
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:48,915
Very well.

771
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:52,920
- Of course.
- Thank you, Terence.

772
00:43:01,326 --> 00:43:02,494
- Kayla.
- Yes.

773
00:43:02,561 --> 00:43:05,098
Wow, what a view!

774
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,067
So, what are
your bridesmaids colors?

775
00:43:07,132 --> 00:43:08,301
I lost my ring.

776
00:43:08,935 --> 00:43:10,103
The big one?

777
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,904
Yeah, my big one.
My... My only one.

778
00:43:11,971 --> 00:43:13,273
How?

779
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:15,241
Well, I was,
I was on my way to the spa,

780
00:43:15,308 --> 00:43:17,277
and Ben had told me
to put it in the safe

781
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,978
because he's always convinced
that I'm gonna lose it.

782
00:43:19,045 --> 00:43:21,114
But you did lose it.

783
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,849
Yeah, I mean, I misplaced it.

784
00:43:22,915 --> 00:43:24,683
I thought first someone
must've taken it, but...

785
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,754
And would you say
that it is still in the spa?

786
00:43:28,822 --> 00:43:30,156
Or the pool.

787
00:43:30,223 --> 00:43:31,858
Or the lounge. I was
all over the place today,

788
00:43:31,924 --> 00:43:34,527
but I don't want Ben to know
that it was ever missing.

789
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:37,831
Really? I mean,
won't he just be all adorable

790
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:39,198
and understanding about it?

791
00:43:39,264 --> 00:43:40,333
Babe,
that was a really big ring.

792
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,536
- Ah. Understood.
- Hey.

793
00:43:43,036 --> 00:43:44,104
Hi.

794
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:45,638
- Hi.
- What did my dad want?

795
00:43:45,705 --> 00:43:47,840
Nothing. He was just, uh,
we were just kinda bonding.

796
00:43:47,907 --> 00:43:49,009
Great.

797
00:43:53,813 --> 00:43:55,248
Uh, where is your ring?

798
00:43:56,116 --> 00:43:56,983
Which ring?

799
00:43:57,049 --> 00:43:58,284
Your engagement ring?

800
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:01,788
The giant one
that I gave you for love.

801
00:44:01,855 --> 00:44:04,190
Oh, um... I...

802
00:44:04,257 --> 00:44:06,226
Uh, the thing is...

803
00:44:06,293 --> 00:44:09,195
It's a funny story
actually, sir.

804
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:10,729
I actually took it.

805
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:11,865
Yes, I did.

806
00:44:11,931 --> 00:44:14,133
- To go get cleaned.
- Oh.

807
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:16,802
I took it to go get
a scrub-a-dub

808
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:18,804
and be all shiny
for the wedding.

809
00:44:18,871 --> 00:44:20,438
Bright as bright as a diamond.

810
00:44:20,505 --> 00:44:22,107
Great. That's actually
very thoughtful.

811
00:44:22,174 --> 00:44:23,744
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Kayla.

812
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,145
By the way, we really wanna put

813
00:44:25,212 --> 00:44:26,779
some kind of gratuity
for you on the bill.

814
00:44:26,846 --> 00:44:28,715
Whatever you see fit, sir.

815
00:44:28,781 --> 00:44:30,082
- Thanks.
- Love you, guys.

816
00:44:30,148 --> 00:44:31,217
- Love you.
- In different ways.

817
00:44:32,118 --> 00:44:33,752
Thank you.

818
00:44:33,819 --> 00:44:35,587
Anytime.

819
00:44:37,089 --> 00:44:38,725
Whoop. Excuse me.

820
00:44:40,726 --> 00:44:43,094
Come on, come on, come on.

821
00:44:43,161 --> 00:44:44,429
Stop, stop! Stop!

822
00:44:44,496 --> 00:44:46,331
Ow!

823
00:44:46,398 --> 00:44:48,634
- No, no, no, wait, wait!
- Uh-oh.

824
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:50,503
- What?
- Here it comes.

825
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:51,837
Are you okay?

826
00:44:51,904 --> 00:44:53,272
- Oh, yes.
- No, no, no!

827
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:54,741
Oh, come on!

828
00:44:54,806 --> 00:44:56,676
Stop the beeping! You're
making him self-conscious!

829
00:44:56,743 --> 00:44:58,043
How many burritos

830
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,612
did you eat?

831
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:00,980
Oh!

832
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:02,315
I see what you did.

833
00:45:02,382 --> 00:45:03,983
Okay.

834
00:45:06,886 --> 00:45:08,354
I'm scooping the poop, huh?

835
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,989
You saw he did it on purpose...

836
00:45:10,056 --> 00:45:11,523
Let's go!

837
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:28,541
Joy?

838
00:45:28,607 --> 00:45:29,441
Hey, Kayla,

839
00:45:29,507 --> 00:45:31,677
oh, how's the mouse hunt going?

840
00:45:31,744 --> 00:45:32,779
Oh, it's going.

841
00:45:32,846 --> 00:45:34,114
By the way,
quick question for you.

842
00:45:34,181 --> 00:45:36,516
Say a VIP person lost a ring

843
00:45:36,581 --> 00:45:39,217
and someone wanted
to look for said ring

844
00:45:39,284 --> 00:45:41,520
without raising any eyebrows,

845
00:45:41,587 --> 00:45:43,489
where would you say
that person should look?

846
00:45:43,556 --> 00:45:47,159
Oh, my God, I, I,
I love riddles. Um...

847
00:45:47,226 --> 00:45:49,962
Well, if I were that someone,

848
00:45:50,029 --> 00:45:50,962
ah, but I'm not.

849
00:45:51,029 --> 00:45:52,431
But I could be. Who knows?

850
00:45:52,498 --> 00:45:55,768
One day. One can only dream.

851
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:57,637
VIP.

852
00:45:59,438 --> 00:46:01,607
Sorry, back to the question.
Um...

853
00:46:01,674 --> 00:46:03,375
It would depend
on the size of the object.

854
00:46:03,442 --> 00:46:07,147
Is it a car? Is it alive?
Could it be a dog?

855
00:46:07,214 --> 00:46:08,547
I lose things all the time.

856
00:46:08,614 --> 00:46:10,448
I lost my baby brother
last week.

857
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:11,984
Don't tell anyone, please,

858
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:15,054
because I was like,
"Joey, where are you? Please?"

859
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:17,389
And then, thank the Lord, he...

860
00:46:20,893 --> 00:46:21,761
Yeah.

861
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,179
Tom! What?

862
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:22,648
Whoa, whoa, whoa, chill out!

863
00:48:22,715 --> 00:48:24,250
Besides, that is never gonna

864
00:48:24,317 --> 00:48:26,286
keep out
that minuscule sociopath.

865
00:48:28,721 --> 00:48:30,889
What do you mean, he's gone?

866
00:48:30,956 --> 00:48:34,326
Like, like gone-gone?

867
00:48:34,393 --> 00:48:35,829
Are you sure?

868
00:48:38,029 --> 00:48:40,833
Yes! Booyah, Tom! Oh!

869
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,603
<i>♪ More hot milk
for you tonight ♪</i>

870
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,537
Boom!

871
00:48:46,973 --> 00:48:49,141
Mr. Dubros,

872
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:50,509
I am delighted to inform you

873
00:48:50,576 --> 00:48:53,112
that the job
that we hired Tom for,

874
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:54,847
- it is completed.
- Oh, wonderful.

875
00:48:54,913 --> 00:48:56,681
Now we just have to figure out
how to let him go

876
00:48:56,748 --> 00:48:58,750
without triggering
an equal employment issue.

877
00:48:58,817 --> 00:49:00,051
Oh.

878
00:49:00,118 --> 00:49:01,486
I should probably look into
severance packages.

879
00:49:01,554 --> 00:49:02,822
- Right.
- Maybe a month of tuna?

880
00:49:02,889 --> 00:49:04,924
- 'Cause he's a cat.
- Mm-hmm.

881
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:06,693
I think
it's one per family.

882
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:09,161
And if there's any way to make
sure the guests get these

883
00:49:09,228 --> 00:49:10,462
as soon as they check in...

884
00:49:10,529 --> 00:49:12,464
The bride's taken
quite a shine to you.

885
00:49:14,266 --> 00:49:15,734
I don't know, I mean,

886
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:17,402
whatever I can do to help
with the wedding craziness.

887
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:19,038
They seem really stressed out
with it all.

888
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,406
If anything, the ceremony

889
00:49:20,473 --> 00:49:21,873
is the perfect test
for a relationship.

890
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,076
'Cause you can promise
all you want in the vows.

891
00:49:24,143 --> 00:49:25,610
When it comes down to it,

892
00:49:25,677 --> 00:49:27,145
it's how you handle
the pressure of the planning.

893
00:49:27,212 --> 00:49:31,484
Some couples rise to
the challenge and others fall.

894
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:34,485
Hmm. I should write that down.

895
00:49:38,924 --> 00:49:42,895
So, did Tom tell you
the good news?

896
00:49:42,962 --> 00:49:46,431
The mouse problem
has officially been handled.

897
00:49:46,498 --> 00:49:49,601
Hey! She came, she saw,
she exterminated.

898
00:49:49,668 --> 00:49:51,804
Yeah.

899
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,641
So, how about we celebrate?

900
00:49:54,706 --> 00:49:56,442
Flat club soda coming right up.

901
00:49:56,509 --> 00:49:57,543
Yeah, there we go.

902
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:00,013
The real wild stuff.

903
00:50:03,782 --> 00:50:06,284
Wow, those little paws
move quick, huh?

904
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:07,386
You should be his manager.

905
00:50:09,253 --> 00:50:10,889
I mean, sure, why not?

906
00:50:10,956 --> 00:50:12,958
Maybe they'll see
how much I'm killing it

907
00:50:13,025 --> 00:50:16,162
and bring me on permanently
to run everything?

908
00:50:16,228 --> 00:50:19,232
Okay, so somebody thinks
they can skip a few steps.

909
00:50:19,299 --> 00:50:20,367
Mm-mm.

910
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:22,935
No, it's just...

911
00:50:23,002 --> 00:50:24,603
I mean,
where I came from,

912
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,504
there were
no real opportunities.

913
00:50:26,572 --> 00:50:27,540
Where's that?

914
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,542
A small town in Penn State.

915
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:30,909
Picture seeing
your whole future

916
00:50:30,976 --> 00:50:32,411
in front of you
and you can't stand it.

917
00:50:32,478 --> 00:50:34,681
That was me, there.

918
00:50:34,746 --> 00:50:37,082
I just wanted to find that
thing that made me feel...

919
00:50:37,148 --> 00:50:38,750
Important?

920
00:50:38,817 --> 00:50:40,386
Yeah.

921
00:50:40,453 --> 00:50:42,487
And New York seemed like the
right place to look for it.

922
00:50:42,554 --> 00:50:44,957
Well, I mean,
I've heard about your resume.

923
00:50:45,023 --> 00:50:47,159
About that...

924
00:50:47,226 --> 00:50:48,560
Hey, come on, don't be shy.

925
00:50:48,627 --> 00:50:50,629
Whatever shot you're
looking for, you deserve.

926
00:50:50,696 --> 00:50:51,964
You know, you're proof

927
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,431
that it takes more than
a fancy resume

928
00:50:53,498 --> 00:50:55,634
to make it big in New York.
Right?

929
00:50:55,701 --> 00:50:57,469
Guilty as charged.

930
00:51:02,808 --> 00:51:05,043
Toots needs
a little pawpicure.

931
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:07,212
Kayla mentioned
you might have a spot.

932
00:51:07,279 --> 00:51:09,681
We could actually see her right now.

933
00:51:09,748 --> 00:51:12,585
That would be so great.

No, no, no. Stop it.

952
00:52:16,781 --> 00:52:18,549
Both of you.

953
00:52:18,616 --> 00:52:20,985
Why is he alive?
Why is he here?

954
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,622
It's over, Jerry.

955
00:52:23,688 --> 00:52:24,991
I'm calling in the poison guys.

956
00:52:26,891 --> 00:52:28,360
Why do you have Preeta's ring?

957
00:52:28,427 --> 00:52:30,562
Have you had it
this entire time?

958
00:52:30,628 --> 00:52:33,600
Give it to me.
Now. Drop the ring.

959
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:38,271
What do you want for it, Jerry?

960
00:52:41,139 --> 00:52:42,241
You wanna stay here?

961
00:52:42,306 --> 00:52:43,575
You little con artist.

962
00:52:43,641 --> 00:52:45,476
Fine. We can discuss this

963
00:52:45,543 --> 00:52:46,744
on my terms.

964
00:52:46,811 --> 00:52:49,348
Okay, no problem!
I got it!

965
00:52:49,415 --> 00:52:50,650
Tom...

966
00:52:50,717 --> 00:52:52,218
- Excuse me!
- Where did he go?

967
00:52:52,284 --> 00:52:54,887
- Excuse me!
- Tom, where did he go?

968
00:52:54,953 --> 00:52:56,788
- Find him. Now.
- Stop. I said, stop!

969
00:52:56,855 --> 00:52:59,124
Stop! Stop!

970
00:52:59,192 --> 00:53:00,592
<i>Calmate!</i>

971
00:53:00,659 --> 00:53:02,028
I'm the boss.

972
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,334
Why do I see temporary
employees socializing

973
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,502
on hotel property
in the middle of their shift?

974
00:53:10,569 --> 00:53:11,770
We were just...

975
00:53:11,837 --> 00:53:13,205
Terence, we're celebrating,
you know?

976
00:53:13,272 --> 00:53:14,840
The, uh, hotel's mouse problem
is taken care of.

977
00:53:14,906 --> 00:53:16,741
Oh, yeah, congratulations.

978
00:53:16,808 --> 00:53:18,009
Teamwork is dream work, right?

979
00:53:18,076 --> 00:53:20,044
Yeah, it's taken care of,
right, Tom?

980
00:53:20,112 --> 00:53:24,784
It is
so taken care of, right, Tom?

981
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:26,217
What... What is he doing?

982
00:53:26,284 --> 00:53:27,819
He's not doing nothing.

983
00:53:27,886 --> 00:53:29,620
- Why are you acting nervous?
- Huh?

984
00:53:29,688 --> 00:53:30,723
You're acting nervous.

985
00:53:30,788 --> 00:53:32,390
I'm not acting nervous.

986
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,893
No? What's in your pocket?

987
00:53:35,293 --> 00:53:36,295
Ah.

988
00:53:36,362 --> 00:53:37,997
- Oh.
- Terence.

989
00:53:38,063 --> 00:53:39,464
- Wait! No, he's in the pocket.
- Terence, what are you doing?

990
00:53:39,531 --> 00:53:40,665
The mouse
is in the pocket.

991
00:53:42,101 --> 00:53:42,969
Come back here!
Come back here!

992
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:46,172
Oh!

993
00:53:48,773 --> 00:53:50,342
Oh, I'm so sorry!

994
00:53:50,409 --> 00:53:51,677
Whoa!

995
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,418
Come here, pussycat.

996
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:08,127
Everyone, keep calm!

997
00:54:11,063 --> 00:54:12,831
Oh, no!

998
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:15,868
Ooh.

999
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:26,646
The mouse!

1000
00:54:32,518 --> 00:54:34,387
Huh? Whoa!

1001
00:55:00,846 --> 00:55:01,914
Oh...

1002
00:55:03,281 --> 00:55:05,183
What the...

1003
00:55:06,085 --> 00:55:08,720
Oh.

1004
00:55:14,092 --> 00:55:16,763
This is definitely your bad.

1005
00:55:38,717 --> 00:55:40,586
Kayla,
and what would you call this, huh?

1006
00:55:40,652 --> 00:55:41,752
This was a mistake.

1007
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:43,388
It was
a total misunderstanding.

1008
00:55:43,456 --> 00:55:45,123
This is a dereliction of duty!

1009
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:47,894
And it's a reflection
of the absence of character!

1010
00:55:51,163 --> 00:55:52,697
It's an embarrassment
to the hotel.

1011
00:55:52,764 --> 00:55:54,032
And it's an insult to you.

1012
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,967
That's how serious
this matter is, sir.

1013
00:55:56,034 --> 00:55:57,002
I agree.

1014
00:55:58,203 --> 00:56:00,238
Terence,
I'm placing you on leave.

1015
00:56:00,306 --> 00:56:01,507
What?

1016
00:56:01,572 --> 00:56:03,475
It's clear that the magnitude
of this wedding

1017
00:56:03,543 --> 00:56:05,310
has overwhelmed you and you're
in something of a state.

1018
00:56:05,377 --> 00:56:07,179
- I think a break would...
- Hold on a sec. Let me make sure

1019
00:56:07,246 --> 00:56:08,614
that we're
on the same page here

1020
00:56:08,681 --> 00:56:10,749
regarding
the basic facts of this.

1021
00:56:10,815 --> 00:56:13,118
The cat
that she forced us to hire

1022
00:56:13,185 --> 00:56:16,020
failed to catch the mouse.

1023
00:56:16,087 --> 00:56:17,589
Kayla said
she got rid of the mouse.

1024
00:56:17,656 --> 00:56:18,757
Isn't that right?

1025
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:21,260
- That is what I said.
- Ah!

1026
00:56:21,326 --> 00:56:25,297
That is what you said.
But that is not what you did.

1027
00:56:25,364 --> 00:56:29,502
The mouse that caused all that
destruction to our lobby

1028
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:30,701
is still in the hotel.

1029
00:56:30,768 --> 00:56:33,104
I saw him
in the animal tornado.

1030
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:36,242
Terence, listen to yourself.
No one saw a mouse.

1031
00:56:36,308 --> 00:56:37,375
I saw the mouse.

1032
00:56:37,442 --> 00:56:38,743
But they did see you
acting erratically

1033
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,212
towards Miss Forester

1034
00:56:40,279 --> 00:56:42,179
after bringing the groom's
bulldog into a bar.

1035
00:56:42,246 --> 00:56:43,915
She brought the kitty-cat
to the bar, too.

1036
00:56:43,982 --> 00:56:46,018
Tom is an employee.

1037
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:47,452
He has a name tag.

1038
00:56:47,518 --> 00:56:49,120
This is insane.
I'm going insane right now.

1039
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:50,623
Well, you're certainly
acting insane.

1040
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,858
You caused tens of
thousands of dollars of damage

1041
00:56:52,924 --> 00:56:54,993
to the hotel,
you've terrified our guests,

1042
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,697
and now you're attempting
to frame it as Kayla's fault?

1043
00:57:00,866 --> 00:57:02,067
You know what?
You can't do this.

1044
00:57:02,134 --> 00:57:04,770
You can't fire
the event manager

1045
00:57:04,837 --> 00:57:07,072
in the middle of an event.

1046
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:09,975
Please leave
on your own merits, Terence.

1047
00:57:10,042 --> 00:57:11,710
I don't want
to have to call security.

1048
00:57:11,777 --> 00:57:12,878
Please don't do this.

1049
00:57:13,744 --> 00:57:15,348
Oh.

1050
00:57:16,581 --> 00:57:18,016
Okay.

1051
00:57:18,884 --> 00:57:20,018
Okay.

1052
00:57:21,487 --> 00:57:22,753
Argh!

1053
00:57:24,522 --> 00:57:26,158
Oh, my days.

1054
00:57:27,692 --> 00:57:29,060
And I'm not picking it up.

1055
00:57:31,496 --> 00:57:33,165
Get your tail out of your ears.

1056
00:57:33,232 --> 00:57:34,900
It's disgusting.

1057
00:57:36,735 --> 00:57:37,903
Well, this is a disaster.

1058
00:57:37,969 --> 00:57:39,105
Yeah.

1059
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:40,438
Firing our events manager

1060
00:57:40,505 --> 00:57:42,607
before the biggest
and most important event

1061
00:57:42,674 --> 00:57:44,409
this hotel has thrown in years.

1062
00:57:44,476 --> 00:57:46,645
The only reason
I felt comfortable

1063
00:57:46,712 --> 00:57:48,213
asking Terence to take leave

1064
00:57:48,279 --> 00:57:49,447
is because we have someone

1065
00:57:49,514 --> 00:57:51,482
with your wealth
of experience here.

1066
00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:52,884
With the what now?

1067
00:57:52,951 --> 00:57:54,285
I got a call from Miss Preeta.

1068
00:57:54,353 --> 00:57:56,321
She told me
that you quietly found

1069
00:57:56,388 --> 00:57:59,491
a very important missing item
she was looking for.

1070
00:57:59,558 --> 00:58:02,161
You're multitalented, Kayla.

1071
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,295
Do you think you can handle

1072
00:58:03,362 --> 00:58:05,531
the role
of interim event manager?

1073
00:58:06,831 --> 00:58:08,034
Are you kidding?

1074
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:09,935
Yes, yes, of course.

1075
00:58:10,002 --> 00:58:11,337
It's a massive endeavor.

1076
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:14,440
Sir, "massive endeavor"
is my middle name.

1077
00:58:15,473 --> 00:58:16,441
It's Judith,

1078
00:58:17,174 --> 00:58:18,377
but you get the point.

1079
00:58:18,444 --> 00:58:19,545
I know you're new,

1080
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,647
but your employment history
convinces me

1081
00:58:21,712 --> 00:58:23,148
you're qualified
to take this on.

1082
00:58:23,214 --> 00:58:25,683
And who knows,
if this weekend goes well,

1083
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:29,020
we may be discussing a more
permanent position on Monday.

1084
00:58:29,087 --> 00:58:32,757
I can't imagine... anything

1085
00:58:32,824 --> 00:58:35,027
that could
possibly mess this up.

1086
00:58:42,868 --> 00:58:44,002
Stop it.

1087
00:58:44,069 --> 00:58:45,536
You guys gotta stop fighting.

1088
00:58:45,603 --> 00:58:47,572
It's like you've been
doing this for years.

1089
00:58:49,107 --> 00:58:51,643
Listen, first of all,
thank you for the ring.

1090
00:58:53,244 --> 00:58:55,880
Helpful to have it back
after you stole it.

1091
00:58:55,947 --> 00:58:57,215
Never mind.

1092
00:58:57,282 --> 00:58:58,549
Remember when I said
to the both of you

1093
00:58:58,616 --> 00:59:01,152
that letting you stay here
wasn't up to me?

1094
00:59:01,587 --> 00:59:02,521
Well,

1095
00:59:03,855 --> 00:59:05,323
if you look right there,

1096
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:08,726
I'm in charge now, all right?

1097
00:59:08,793 --> 00:59:10,096
And this wedding

1098
00:59:10,161 --> 00:59:11,464
it's a huge responsibility.

1099
00:59:11,529 --> 00:59:13,098
It's the shot
that I've been waiting for

1100
00:59:13,165 --> 00:59:15,100
and I can't screw it up.

1101
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:17,335
So, you two, you gotta go.

1102
00:59:22,975 --> 00:59:24,509
Stop looking at me like that.

1103
00:59:29,714 --> 00:59:31,482
Ugh! Okay.

1104
00:59:31,549 --> 00:59:33,185
Maybe you can stay here.

1105
00:59:33,819 --> 00:59:35,554
But not like this.

1106
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:38,056
Uh-uh. That little mess
you caused downstairs,

1107
00:59:38,123 --> 00:59:39,390
it's a disaster.

1108
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:41,427
You know what,
you wanna stay, right?

1109
00:59:43,228 --> 00:59:45,598
Fine. One condition.

1110
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:50,002
You two have to prove to me
that you can coexist together.

1111
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:52,304
And stay as far away
from here as possible.

1112
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:54,006
Got it?

1113
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,041
So, tomorrow,

1114
00:59:56,107 --> 00:59:57,341
I'm gonna plan an entire day

1115
00:59:57,409 --> 00:59:58,677
for you two to spend together

1116
00:59:59,712 --> 01:00:01,980
out there, in the Big Apple.

1117
01:00:02,681 --> 01:00:04,449
And if you do this,

1118
01:00:04,516 --> 01:00:05,484
you guys can stay.

1119
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:08,119
Do we have a deal?

1120
01:00:10,554 --> 01:00:12,123
Your car will be here
at 9:00 a.m.

1121
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,058
Don't be late.

1122
01:01:01,507 --> 01:01:03,275
<i>Okay, guys,
please, everyone...</i>

1123
01:01:03,342 --> 01:01:05,411
Uh...

1124
01:01:05,478 --> 01:01:06,345
Please...

1125
01:01:07,779 --> 01:01:09,581
Any, any true emergencies?

1126
01:01:09,647 --> 01:01:11,216
True emergencies?

1127
01:01:12,618 --> 01:01:14,286
Let's just go around the room
one at a time.

1128
01:01:14,353 --> 01:01:16,154
I just caught
my finger in the door and...

1129
01:01:16,221 --> 01:01:18,357
Okay, please,
seriously, just shut up, please. Uh...

1130
01:01:19,056 --> 01:01:20,958
Madam Kaydra,

1131
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:22,493
are we sure the mouse is gone?

1132
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,528
Rumors are
the guest list includes

1133
01:01:24,596 --> 01:01:26,898
a Michelin
restaurant inspector,

1134
01:01:26,964 --> 01:01:28,232
so one slip-up

1135
01:01:28,299 --> 01:01:30,969
and me and my son
are out on the streets.

1136
01:01:31,036 --> 01:01:33,205
Jackie, rest assured,

1137
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,373
the mouse is currently
being taken care of.

1138
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,907
Anyone else have
any other problems?

1139
01:01:36,975 --> 01:01:39,743
Uh, did you address
the, um, elephant that's here?

1140
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:41,979
Cameron,

1141
01:01:42,047 --> 01:01:44,182
yes, I addressed
the elephant in the room.

1142
01:01:44,248 --> 01:01:45,216
You weren't here for it.

1143
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,153
Yeah, no, I mean literally.

1144
01:01:58,295 --> 01:01:59,531
Where do you want 'em?

1145
01:01:59,598 --> 01:02:00,898
Um...

1146
01:02:00,964 --> 01:02:02,366
Pardon. The elephants?

1147
01:02:02,433 --> 01:02:03,968
Can't leave 'em in the truck.

1148
01:02:04,036 --> 01:02:06,772
No. That would be inhumane.

1149
01:02:08,773 --> 01:02:12,310
- They can be parked at valet.
- Okay.

1150
01:02:13,911 --> 01:02:15,647
Relax, Cecil.

1151
01:02:42,808 --> 01:02:44,976
Okay. How about we go ahead and put
all the birds in the staff room?

1152
01:02:45,043 --> 01:02:47,346
Um, the animal wrangler
said this time of year

1153
01:02:47,413 --> 01:02:49,482
they need room
to socialize and mate.

1154
01:02:51,715 --> 01:02:53,518
I think they've
socialized enough, Joy.

1155
01:02:53,585 --> 01:02:56,020
This is a wedding after all,
not spring break.

1156
01:02:56,087 --> 01:02:57,154
- Ca-caw!
- So let's just go ahead

1157
01:02:57,221 --> 01:02:58,456
and put 'em in the staff room.

1158
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:01,058
What...

1159
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:03,127
What sound do peacocks make?

1160
01:03:03,194 --> 01:03:04,429
- I mean...
- Ca-caw!

1161
01:03:04,496 --> 01:03:05,697
I think that sounds right.

1162
01:04:07,192 --> 01:04:08,860
Kayla, come on already.

1163
01:04:08,927 --> 01:04:12,398
Oh, gosh, I so regret
saying yes to this.

1164
01:04:14,632 --> 01:04:17,101
Pa-pa-pam-pam!

1165
01:04:17,168 --> 01:04:20,906
Oh, my God.
You look incredible.

1166
01:04:20,971 --> 01:04:22,240
Thank you.

1167
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:25,976
Well, we are
a full-service hotel here.

1168
01:04:26,043 --> 01:04:27,545
Be it dog walking,

1169
01:04:27,612 --> 01:04:31,317
or quite even possibly,
saving someone's lost ring.

1170
01:04:31,715 --> 01:04:32,984
Hmm.

1171
01:04:33,051 --> 01:04:34,319
Is there anything else
I can help you with, milady?

1172
01:04:34,386 --> 01:04:35,654
Oh, no, thank you.

1173
01:04:35,721 --> 01:04:38,090
This wedding
is bonkers enough already.

1174
01:04:38,156 --> 01:04:39,457
Why don't you just say no?

1175
01:04:39,523 --> 01:04:41,226
Oh, no, we've...
We've just decided

1176
01:04:41,293 --> 01:04:43,762
to, um, avoid behaviors

1177
01:04:43,828 --> 01:04:45,663
that might give the impression
that we're fighting.

1178
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:47,699
But what about
when it's just you two?

1179
01:04:47,766 --> 01:04:49,868
I mean, we disagree, of course,

1180
01:04:49,935 --> 01:04:51,070
about how big

1181
01:04:51,136 --> 01:04:52,771
- the wedding should be.
- Wow.

1182
01:04:52,837 --> 01:04:56,941
But I guess there was so much
pressure to maintain an image

1183
01:04:57,009 --> 01:04:59,612
that somewhere
we forgot how to fight.

1184
01:05:01,112 --> 01:05:02,714
Ben really loves you, Preeta.

1185
01:05:02,781 --> 01:05:05,618
Yeah. He's a really good guy.

1186
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:09,219
It's just that when he goes,
he goes big.

1187
01:05:09,286 --> 01:05:10,788
And I love that about him.

1188
01:05:10,855 --> 01:05:11,857
Yeah.

1189
01:05:11,924 --> 01:05:14,559
But I have
this feeling that this

1190
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:18,029
small Indian wedding is gonna
be a great big disaster.

1191
01:05:20,766 --> 01:05:22,634
Beautiful day
at Yankee Stadium.

1192
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:24,569
Top of the 9th inning, two out,

1193
01:05:24,636 --> 01:05:26,538
and the Yankees up by one.

1194
01:05:26,605 --> 01:05:29,107
Big Alex Gordon at the plate.

1195
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:31,241
That ball is crushed.

1196
01:05:31,308 --> 01:05:32,744
This might be it.

1197
01:05:34,011 --> 01:05:35,546
The ball game may be over.

1198
01:05:35,614 --> 01:05:38,016
The Yankees
could move on and...

1199
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:39,952
Oh! What's this?

1200
01:05:40,018 --> 01:05:43,021
A hairy fan has reached over and caught the ball.

1201
01:05:43,087 --> 01:05:45,623
<i>Mayhem
unfolds at Yankee Stadium.</i>

1202
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:47,959
<i>Two baseball fans

1203
01:05:48,025 --> 01:05:49,527

1205

1206
01:05:55,065 --> 01:05:56,301
<i>In other news...</i>

1207
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,508
Oh, my gosh!

1208
01:06:02,574 --> 01:06:03,842
What was...

1209
01:06:05,109 --> 01:06:06,476
Ben, was that a drone?

1210
01:06:06,543 --> 01:06:07,779
Not just any drone.

1211
01:06:07,846 --> 01:06:10,281
That was a CH-4000,
military-grade.

1212
01:06:10,348 --> 01:06:12,116
- Yeah.
- But I'm sure it's harmless.

1213
01:06:13,183 --> 01:06:14,585
Joy?

1214
01:06:14,652 --> 01:06:15,853
- Should I go see what that...
- Yes. Yes, Joy.

1215
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,956
- Oh, okay. Going.
- Yes, Joy, go. Yep.

1216
01:06:18,022 --> 01:06:19,156
That was a scream.

1217
01:06:19,223 --> 01:06:20,424
It's harmless.

1218
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:22,025
Yeah.
Military things usually are.

1219
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:25,129
I got this drone
because I thought,

1220
01:06:25,197 --> 01:06:27,065
uh, when Preeta and I come into
the wedding on the elephants,

1221
01:06:27,132 --> 01:06:29,768
that the drone
could be kind of, uh...

1222
01:06:29,835 --> 01:06:32,503
As I'm saying the words
"drone" and "elephant,"

1223
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,105
out loud
to another human being,

1224
01:06:34,172 --> 01:06:36,840
I'm wondering, is this, um...

1225
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:37,775
is this a lot?

1226
01:06:38,543 --> 01:06:40,646
Weddings, Ben,

1227
01:06:40,712 --> 01:06:42,246
they're already
stressful enough,

1228
01:06:42,313 --> 01:06:43,513
- you know?
- Yeah.

1229
01:06:43,581 --> 01:06:44,649
The important part
is that Preeta,

1230
01:06:44,715 --> 01:06:46,384
she can't wait to marry you.

1231
01:06:46,451 --> 01:06:47,586
So, just take it easy,
you know?

1232
01:06:47,652 --> 01:06:49,487
Enjoy the ride.

1233
01:06:49,554 --> 01:06:50,955
- Yeah.
- You only got one shot at it.

1234
01:06:51,022 --> 01:06:53,357
Like, one chance to,
like, get it right.

1235
01:06:53,424 --> 01:06:56,160
Uh-huh. So just go ahead
and pull it back.

1236
01:06:56,228 --> 01:06:59,865
Yeah. Pull it back
and just sorta let it rip.

1237
01:06:59,931 --> 01:07:02,067
Like, really,
just pull it way back

1238
01:07:02,134 --> 01:07:03,368
and just explode out of it.

1239
01:07:03,433 --> 01:07:04,601
That is not what I was

1240
01:07:04,668 --> 01:07:05,770
- trying to say to you.
- Yeah.

1241
01:07:07,105 --> 01:07:08,773
They said they'd
disabled the weapons.

1242
01:07:08,839 --> 01:07:11,409
- There's weapons?
- Uh, I'll make sure.

1243
01:07:11,476 --> 01:07:12,811
I found it.

1244
01:07:12,877 --> 01:07:13,944
I found the...

1245
01:07:14,011 --> 01:07:16,447
Oh, my God!
Help me, help me, help me!

1246
01:07:17,281 --> 01:07:18,417
She found it.

1247
01:07:18,482 --> 01:07:19,751
Don't look it in the eyes, Joy.

1248
01:07:26,324 --> 01:07:27,658
Welcome to your new home,
gentlemen.

1249
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,436
Hey, hey, hey, pipe down!
You already been fed.

1250
01:07:39,071 --> 01:07:40,172
Hello.

1251
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:42,674
Quiet.

1252
01:07:50,982 --> 01:07:53,785
Get comfortable.
You're gonna be here a while.

1253
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,221
Have a nice stay!

1254
01:07:57,288 --> 01:08:00,357
<i>♪ Alley cats ♪</i>

1255
01:08:00,424 --> 01:08:03,594
<i>♪ Come out and play ♪</i>

1256
01:08:03,661 --> 01:08:05,263
That's that cat
from the alley!

1257
01:08:05,328 --> 01:08:06,764
Well, well, well.

1258
01:08:06,831 --> 01:08:09,000
So, we meet again.
You know, you and me?

1259
01:08:09,067 --> 01:08:11,603
We got some
unfinished business to settle.

1260
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:12,837
Dinner time.

1261
01:08:12,904 --> 01:08:14,272
Snack is what
I like to call it.

1262
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:15,840
Relax, you two.

1263
01:08:15,906 --> 01:08:19,177
This won't take long,
as long as you don't fight it.

1264
01:08:19,244 --> 01:08:20,145
Gotcha.

1265
01:08:21,913 --> 01:08:24,016
Oh, don't be scared,
come here!

1266
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:25,417
Are you gonna eat him?

1267
01:08:25,484 --> 01:08:27,352
Why don't you be a good
little kitty and hand him over

1268
01:08:27,418 --> 01:08:29,053
before I stop being nice?

1269
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,190
Yeah, what are you, like,
friends or something?

1270
01:08:32,255 --> 01:08:34,825
Go ahead. Eat him now.

1271
01:08:34,892 --> 01:08:37,661
If we can't eat him,
you gotta eat him.

1272
01:08:37,728 --> 01:08:39,364
Looks like
a nice snack.

1273
01:08:39,431 --> 01:08:40,932
Chew. Chew.

1274
01:08:40,998 --> 01:08:42,734
- Eat him. Eat. Eat.
- Chew. Chew. Chew.

1275
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:44,535
- Eat it.
- Chew. Chew.

1276
01:08:44,602 --> 01:08:47,171
Ah, ah,
there you go. Bottoms up!

1277
01:08:47,237 --> 01:08:49,775
- Eat him!
- There you go!

1278
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:54,213
Is it as good
as it looks?

1279
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:56,682
What are you waiting for? Chew.

1280
01:08:57,648 --> 01:08:58,816
Chew. Chew.

1281
01:08:58,883 --> 01:09:00,084
Chew. Chew. Chew. Chew.

1282
01:09:00,151 --> 01:09:02,719
If you don't start chewing,
we will.

1283
01:09:02,786 --> 01:09:04,455
Oh, that's spicy.
Cajun.

1284
01:09:04,522 --> 01:09:05,989
Chew. Chew. Chew.

1285
01:09:06,057 --> 01:09:08,026
Wait a minute. Something
ain't right. Open your mouth.

1286
01:09:08,093 --> 01:09:09,494
You heard him,
open your trap!

1287
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:10,661
Hey, cat.

1288
01:09:13,764 --> 01:09:14,999
You got a visitor.

1289
01:09:15,066 --> 01:09:16,534
- What?
- Visitors?

1290
01:09:16,601 --> 01:09:17,668
He didn't even eat him!

1291
01:09:17,735 --> 01:09:19,204
Mouse, you got one, too.

1292
01:09:25,944 --> 01:09:27,012
<i>Hola,</i> Tom.

1293
01:09:29,213 --> 01:09:30,648
How are they treating you?

1294
01:09:30,715 --> 01:09:32,618
This place is, uh, horrible.

1295
01:09:34,018 --> 01:09:34,887
Cheese stick?

1296
01:09:37,621 --> 01:09:38,723
Oh, you don't want it?

1297
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:41,159
Here's the deal.

1298
01:09:41,226 --> 01:09:43,128
I know you wanna
come back to the hotel,

1299
01:09:44,361 --> 01:09:45,797
and I can help you do it.

1300
01:09:45,864 --> 01:09:47,063
As you may already know,

1301
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:48,933
Kayla's been put
in charge of the wedding.

1302
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,701
And, yeah, it's a tough job.

1303
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:52,703
That's why she sent me here
to bring you back.

1304
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:54,205
So you can help.

1305
01:09:54,271 --> 01:09:55,206
But there's a catch.

1306
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,344
I can only take one of you.

1307
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:00,746
You know what your friend said?

1308
01:10:01,846 --> 01:10:03,714
That it's your fault.

1309
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:05,749
Maybe I shouldn't say this,
you know?

1310
01:10:05,816 --> 01:10:08,652
He says you smell like...
Like tuna.

1311
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,755
And a cheesy foot.

1312
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:12,490
He also said that you're, uh...

1313
01:10:12,557 --> 01:10:14,960
You're emotionally unavailable.

1314
01:10:15,026 --> 01:10:17,227
He also wants
you to stay here and rot.

1315
01:10:17,294 --> 01:10:19,596
Now, you put me
in such a tough position.

1316
01:10:19,664 --> 01:10:21,032
As you already know,

1317
01:10:21,098 --> 01:10:23,133
I can only take one of you
back to the hotel.

1318
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,668
Will it be the cat?

1319
01:10:24,736 --> 01:10:25,971
Or the mouse?

1320
01:10:26,405 --> 01:10:27,438
Okay.

1321
01:10:27,504 --> 01:10:28,772
I've made my decision.

1322
01:10:35,312 --> 01:10:37,047
Check this out.

1323
01:10:37,115 --> 01:10:39,117
In celebrity news,
major commotion at the Royal Gate Hotel

1324
01:10:39,183 --> 01:10:40,851
as New York's elite couple,
Preeta and Ben,

1325
01:10:40,919 --> 01:10:42,820
are tying the knot in
a private, intimate wedding.

1326
01:10:56,601 --> 01:10:58,236
Ah... Ah...

1327
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,738
Ta-da!

1328
01:11:01,106 --> 01:11:02,107
Ta-da!

1329
01:11:02,673 --> 01:11:03,841
Okay.

1330
01:11:03,909 --> 01:11:05,744
No, no. No, no, no.

1331
01:11:08,379 --> 01:11:09,614
Move.

1332
01:11:13,384 --> 01:11:15,020
Mr. Mehta, what do you think?

1333
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,255
You're not wearing a turban.

1334
01:11:18,322 --> 01:11:22,125
Is that, Is that a question
or a statement?

1335
01:11:22,192 --> 01:11:24,628
I didn't know
if you wanted an answer.

1336
01:11:24,695 --> 01:11:26,931
I've been getting
really into cricket!

1337
01:11:28,932 --> 01:11:30,101
You're doing great.

1338
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:32,737
How are we doing
on the champagne?

1339
01:11:32,803 --> 01:11:34,172
We good, we good.

1340
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,074
There's just a lot of it,
and not enough hands.

1341
01:11:36,141 --> 01:11:37,174
Okay.

1342
01:11:37,241 --> 01:11:38,709
All right, bro.
Take these upstairs.

1343
01:11:38,776 --> 01:11:40,011
I'll be up in a minute.
You good?

1344
01:11:40,078 --> 01:11:41,980
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1345
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:43,514
<i>Momma bird,
we got a problem here. We need you.</i>

1346
01:11:43,581 --> 01:11:44,581
Okay, on my way.

1347
01:11:58,495 --> 01:12:01,065
- Hmm.
- What?

1348
01:12:01,133 --> 01:12:02,934
I think I might have
just pulled this off.

1349
01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:07,271
Ladies and gentlemen,
the ceremony is about to begin.

1350
01:12:07,338 --> 01:12:10,341
All right, Malcolm,
game face, look impressive.

1351
01:12:10,407 --> 01:12:12,776
FYI, I'm always ready.

1352
01:12:12,843 --> 01:12:14,712
LOL.

1353
01:12:14,779 --> 01:12:16,280
Ben, this feels
so embarrassing.

1354
01:12:16,347 --> 01:12:19,751
Well, if it's any consolation,
you look very beautiful.

1355
01:12:19,817 --> 01:12:22,454
And in a way,
you know, we're the elephants.

1356
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,022
Because we're never
gonna forget this wedding.

1357
01:12:25,089 --> 01:12:26,656
Here we go.

1358
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,362
Wow!

1359
01:12:31,428 --> 01:12:32,864
Preeta!

1360
01:12:34,798 --> 01:12:36,234
Wow.

1361
01:12:36,301 --> 01:12:37,901
The, the elephant are normal
in these kind of events?

1362
01:12:37,968 --> 01:12:40,504
We are an elephant-friendly
establishment.

1363
01:12:40,571 --> 01:12:41,940
Friendly establishment.

1364
01:12:48,678 --> 01:12:50,815
Wow.

1365
01:12:50,882 --> 01:12:53,085
That's really beautiful.

1366
01:12:55,186 --> 01:12:57,022
The elephants
were a great choice.

1367
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:02,828
Welcome back.

1368
01:13:06,731 --> 01:13:09,300
Consider this wedding
a welcome party.

1369
01:13:09,366 --> 01:13:10,735
Just for you.

1370
01:13:12,603 --> 01:13:14,004
Oh, no.

1371
01:13:14,472 --> 01:13:15,773
No.

1372
01:13:16,574 --> 01:13:18,777
What is Jerry doing here?

1373
01:13:19,777 --> 01:13:21,178
Well, that must be awkward.

1374
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:23,882
With all the horrible things
he said about you.

1375
01:13:23,947 --> 01:13:26,817
That you're not fit
to work at the Royal Gate.

1376
01:13:26,883 --> 01:13:29,886
Tom, come on, now.
Let's not be insensitive.

1377
01:13:29,954 --> 01:13:31,956
Oh, would you just
leave him alone already?

1378
01:13:32,022 --> 01:13:33,257
Well, I got something to say.

1379
01:13:33,324 --> 01:13:34,959
Okay, go ahead and speak, then!

1380
01:13:35,026 --> 01:13:35,994
As I was saying...

1381
01:13:39,731 --> 01:13:41,366
Gotcha!

1382
01:13:41,432 --> 01:13:43,301
Now let's go finish
what we started.

1383
01:13:45,136 --> 01:13:46,937
Have fun.

1384
01:13:57,382 --> 01:13:58,282
Why is Tom here?

1385
01:13:59,584 --> 01:14:00,752
What the...

1386
01:14:00,819 --> 01:14:01,785
I don't see Jerry.
Do you see Jerry?

1387
01:14:01,852 --> 01:14:03,821
Uh, no. I don't.

1388
01:14:03,888 --> 01:14:05,889
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

1389
01:14:05,956 --> 01:14:08,058
Isn't this great?
And look, your dad loves it.

1390
01:14:08,124 --> 01:14:09,592
At least,
I think he's loving it.

1391
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:10,761
It's kinda hard to tell.

1392
01:14:10,828 --> 01:14:12,263
Not bad.

1393
01:14:15,032 --> 01:14:16,868
Ah. Smile for the drone-cam.

1394
01:14:16,935 --> 01:14:18,169
Drone-cam?

1395
01:14:18,236 --> 01:14:20,638
Yeah. They can put
a cam on a drone.

1396
01:14:20,704 --> 01:14:21,972
Wait. Are those peacocks?

1397
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:23,808
Yeah, I think they might
have just been

1398
01:14:23,874 --> 01:14:26,176
part of the, uh,
exotic bird package.

1399
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:33,517
And, and even the tiger?

1400
01:14:33,584 --> 01:14:34,985
Well, the tiger is our first.

1401
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,156
I begged you
to stop doing this stuff.

1402
01:14:38,222 --> 01:14:41,458
I'm sorry.
That is the last surprise.

1403
01:14:41,525 --> 01:14:42,527
You just don't listen.

1404
01:14:42,593 --> 01:14:43,995
Listen to what?

1405
01:14:56,173 --> 01:14:57,042
Hmm?

1406
01:15:14,157 --> 01:15:15,125
No, Tom. Don't do it.

1407
01:15:15,192 --> 01:15:17,862
Do it, Tom. Do it.

1408
01:15:26,838 --> 01:15:28,240
You're dead, mouse.

1409
01:15:50,895 --> 01:15:52,630
Yes!

1410
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:07,945
OMG. Is that a mouse?

1411
01:16:08,012 --> 01:16:11,215
WT...

1412
01:16:11,883 --> 01:16:12,750
Preeta!

1413
01:16:14,585 --> 01:16:15,852
Mouse! Mouse!

1414
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:18,123
Mouse, mouse, mouse,
mouse, mouse!

1415
01:16:19,223 --> 01:16:20,691
- We got him.
- Oh, my baby!

1416
01:16:20,758 --> 01:16:21,991
No, no. Stay calm, everyone!

1417
01:16:22,058 --> 01:16:23,093
Mouse! Ahh!

1418
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,861
Mouse! Mouse!

1419
01:16:26,763 --> 01:16:28,532
Mouse! Ah, mouse!

1420
01:16:30,735 --> 01:16:33,071
Ugh. Get off.

1421
01:16:37,307 --> 01:16:38,075
You?

1422
01:16:38,142 --> 01:16:40,710
No. Me.

1423
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:48,753
Mouse, mouse,
mouse, mouse, mouse!

1424
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:51,156
Mouse!

1425
01:17:08,204 --> 01:17:09,673
Please remain calm.

1426
01:17:14,411 --> 01:17:16,045
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

1427
01:17:20,084 --> 01:17:22,953
Malcolm!
I'm coming to save you!

1428
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:24,254
Oh, no!

1429
01:17:24,321 --> 01:17:25,556
Huh? Oh.

1430
01:17:35,499 --> 01:17:36,467
Preeta!

1431
01:17:44,709 --> 01:17:45,643
Out the back door.

1432
01:17:47,011 --> 01:17:49,446
Let's get out of here!

1433
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:53,251
Oh, no!

1434
01:18:12,236 --> 01:18:14,706
Cecil! Malcolm!

1435
01:18:15,539 --> 01:18:17,574
Stop! Stop!

1436
01:18:27,217 --> 01:18:28,886
What is he doing here?

1437
01:18:28,953 --> 01:18:31,121
Terence is here
because he tried to warn me

1438
01:18:31,188 --> 01:18:33,857
about Kayla, who clearly lied
about who she is.

1439
01:18:33,924 --> 01:18:38,329
No, sir. Uh, this was a misunderstanding.
It was, um...

1440
01:18:42,133 --> 01:18:43,835
No.

1441
01:18:43,901 --> 01:18:46,304
Actually, it wasn't
a misunderstanding.

1442
01:18:48,873 --> 01:18:51,209
Sir, when I came
into your office that day,

1443
01:18:52,343 --> 01:18:54,779
I had stolen
someone else's resume...

1444
01:18:57,181 --> 01:18:58,817
and pretended that it was mine.

1445
01:19:04,221 --> 01:19:06,391
I don't have
any qualifications for this.

1446
01:19:10,061 --> 01:19:12,563
Or for anything, really.

1447
01:19:12,629 --> 01:19:14,531
You not only
destroyed this wedding,

1448
01:19:14,598 --> 01:19:17,768
but may have destroyed
the future of this hotel.

1449
01:19:18,936 --> 01:19:19,804
I'm sorry.

1450
01:19:21,038 --> 01:19:22,806
Perhaps I could salvage this.

1451
01:19:22,873 --> 01:19:23,875
Don't bother.

1452
01:19:27,678 --> 01:19:32,217
I just came here
to inform Mr. Dubros

1453
01:19:33,116 --> 01:19:34,351
that the wedding's off.

1454
01:19:39,923 --> 01:19:40,792
Preeta.

1455
01:19:45,129 --> 01:19:46,197
Oh...

1456
01:20:06,284 --> 01:20:08,152
I guess we were both
in over our heads.

1457
01:20:08,218 --> 01:20:09,786
I...

1458
01:20:14,657 --> 01:20:15,926
Kayla, I don't get
why you just...

1459
01:20:15,993 --> 01:20:17,294
I was gonna tell you, Cameron.

1460
01:20:18,795 --> 01:20:21,766
I was gonna tell
all of you the truth.

1461
01:20:21,831 --> 01:20:24,869
I just wanted to prove to
you all that I deserved this.

1462
01:20:24,935 --> 01:20:26,271
That I could do this.

1463
01:20:31,008 --> 01:20:31,876
I'm sorry.

1464
01:20:58,268 --> 01:21:00,271
And don't even
think about coming back.

1465
01:21:01,871 --> 01:21:03,673
You think I was gonna
let some street animals

1466
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:05,810
live at the Royal Gate Hotel?

1467
01:21:05,877 --> 01:21:06,744
Oh, no.

1468
01:22:24,954 --> 01:22:26,890
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me.

1469
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:28,960
I know I wasn't
very convincing yesterday.

1470
01:22:29,026 --> 01:22:32,696
But what I was trying to say
was, I really am sorry.

1471
01:22:32,762 --> 01:22:34,430
I still can't believe
that I saw everything

1472
01:22:34,498 --> 01:22:36,200
that woman accomplished
on her resume,

1473
01:22:36,266 --> 01:22:40,004
and I thought that my pure
ambition was an even swap.

1474
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:41,138
Come on, Kayla,

1475
01:22:41,204 --> 01:22:42,839
everybody screws up.

1476
01:22:42,905 --> 01:22:44,141
It's just hard.

1477
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:45,509
I mean, every morning I wake up

1478
01:22:45,575 --> 01:22:46,843
and I look at my phone,

1479
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:48,378
and my newsfeed
is filled with people

1480
01:22:48,445 --> 01:22:49,912
who are our age,

1481
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,048
you know, they're succeeding
at what they're doing.

1482
01:22:51,115 --> 01:22:52,417
Well, maybe we just need

1483
01:22:52,482 --> 01:22:54,517
to stop comparing ourselves
to everybody

1484
01:22:54,584 --> 01:22:56,253
and just work for it.

1485
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,388
Listen, Kayla,

1486
01:22:57,454 --> 01:22:58,855
you're gonna get the skills.

1487
01:22:58,922 --> 01:23:01,025
You already got the smarts,
you got the funny,

1488
01:23:01,092 --> 01:23:02,726
and you got the love
of helping people.

1489
01:23:02,793 --> 01:23:05,496
Even if I wanted to make
this right, I couldn't.

1490
01:23:05,562 --> 01:23:08,331
Well, maybe they

1491
01:23:08,398 --> 01:23:10,034
can help
convince you otherwise.

1492
01:23:10,101 --> 01:23:11,668
No.

1493
01:23:11,735 --> 01:23:13,004
You two are the last people
that I wanna see right now.

1494
01:23:16,173 --> 01:23:17,041
What is all this?

1495
01:23:18,676 --> 01:23:23,379
I think that's Preeta and Ben.

1496
01:23:23,446 --> 01:23:26,351
All right, you know what? Just cut the
chalkboard act and tell me what's going on.

1497
01:23:28,218 --> 01:23:30,119
Okay, you and Jerry
have an idea for what?

1498
01:23:30,187 --> 01:23:31,089
How did you...

1499
01:23:34,557 --> 01:23:35,491
Elephants?

1500
01:23:35,558 --> 01:23:37,227
Ca-caw!

1501
01:23:37,294 --> 01:23:39,063
And peacocks? A big cake?

1502
01:23:39,129 --> 01:23:41,264
Guys, are you
just making fun of me?

1503
01:23:41,331 --> 01:23:42,833
Oh, so, this is like charades?

1504
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:43,834
No.

1505
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,502
'Cause he did like a...

1506
01:23:45,569 --> 01:23:48,739
No? All right, never mind.

1507
01:23:48,806 --> 01:23:51,409
I think what they're
trying to tell us

1508
01:23:51,476 --> 01:23:53,044
is that if we go back
to the hotel,

1509
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:54,445
quickly salvage what we can,

1510
01:23:54,511 --> 01:23:56,480
and we find a last-minute venue

1511
01:23:56,547 --> 01:23:58,181
and some sort
of befitting celebrant,

1512
01:23:58,248 --> 01:24:00,384
we can fix this by putting on
a makeshift wedding.

1513
01:24:02,352 --> 01:24:05,155
And you got
all of that from that?

1514
01:24:05,222 --> 01:24:06,456
Yeah.

1515
01:24:06,523 --> 01:24:08,258
We kinda understand
each other now.

1516
01:24:08,325 --> 01:24:09,258
Let's do it.

1517
01:24:09,325 --> 01:24:10,793
What do we have to lose?

1518
01:24:24,975 --> 01:24:25,843
Hey.

1519
01:24:26,575 --> 01:24:27,645
Where's Preeta going?

1520
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:29,713
A doorman never tells.

1521
01:24:31,214 --> 01:24:32,181
JFK.

1522
01:24:34,918 --> 01:24:36,954
Okay, guys. I know that
you both don't get along,

1523
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,356
but now it's time
to change that.

1524
01:24:39,423 --> 01:24:42,292
So, help me save this wedding
and go catch that bride, okay?

1525
01:24:42,359 --> 01:24:43,593
And bring her back here.

1526
01:24:49,299 --> 01:24:50,601
What do you want?

1527
01:24:50,667 --> 01:24:51,968
I just need to talk to Ben
for a minute.

1528
01:24:52,035 --> 01:24:53,437
No, don't you think
you've done enough?

1529
01:24:53,504 --> 01:24:55,039
Ben. This wedding
can still happen, today.

1530
01:24:55,106 --> 01:24:57,374
How? I mean,
everything's destroyed.

1531
01:24:57,441 --> 01:24:58,776
It doesn't matter.

1532
01:24:58,843 --> 01:25:01,612
Preeta never actually
wanted any of this.

1533
01:25:01,678 --> 01:25:03,746
She just wanted
you to listen to her.

1534
01:25:03,813 --> 01:25:05,548
I, I don't think so.

1535
01:25:05,615 --> 01:25:07,750
Wait. Someone once told me

1536
01:25:07,817 --> 01:25:10,454
that a wedding
is a couple's very first test.

1537
01:25:10,521 --> 01:25:11,521
And some couples,

1538
01:25:11,588 --> 01:25:13,389
well, they rise to that.

1539
01:25:13,456 --> 01:25:14,490
Stupid.

1540
01:25:14,557 --> 01:25:15,859
What kind of idiot said that?

1541
01:25:15,926 --> 01:25:17,995
- I mean, seriously...
- Me.

1542
01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:19,597
Oh.

1543
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:21,865
I apologize. I'm sorry.

1544
01:25:21,932 --> 01:25:24,935
I was being, uh, sarcastic.

1545
01:25:25,002 --> 01:25:28,871
You can rise, Ben.
We can still pull this off.

1546
01:25:28,938 --> 01:25:31,609
Needless to say,
everything at this hotel

1547
01:25:31,674 --> 01:25:32,842
will be at your disposal.

1548
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:35,212
Except, of course, the hotel.

1549
01:25:35,277 --> 01:25:36,446
What about the garden

1550
01:25:36,513 --> 01:25:37,581
across the street?

1551
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:39,816
Uh, I'm sorry, garden?

1552
01:25:39,883 --> 01:25:40,717
Mm-hmm.

1553
01:25:40,784 --> 01:25:43,087
Wait, do you mean Central Park?

1554
01:25:43,154 --> 01:25:45,589
Sure. Whatever nickname
you have for it.

1555
01:25:45,655 --> 01:25:48,191
That's actually
an amazing idea.

1556
01:25:48,258 --> 01:25:49,694
Joy, thank you.

1557
01:25:50,561 --> 01:25:51,428
Yeah?

1558
01:25:51,495 --> 01:25:52,496
Yeah.

1559
01:25:52,562 --> 01:25:53,831
Well, how about, Terence,

1560
01:25:53,897 --> 01:25:55,199
you and Ben
get a guest list together,

1561
01:25:55,264 --> 01:25:56,432
and then let everyone know
where to meet us?

1562
01:25:56,499 --> 01:25:57,834
You expect me to assist you

1563
01:25:57,901 --> 01:25:59,803
after what you've done
to this hotel?

1564
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:01,305
I think we both did some things

1565
01:26:01,371 --> 01:26:03,106
that we regret
to keep our jobs.

1566
01:26:03,173 --> 01:26:05,142
Tom and Jerry
told me what you did.

1567
01:26:06,611 --> 01:26:08,112
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

1568
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:11,749
Okay, thank you.

1569
01:26:11,815 --> 01:26:14,485
If Tom and Jerry can be
out there working together,

1570
01:26:14,551 --> 01:26:15,652
then so can we.

1571
01:26:27,264 --> 01:26:28,699
<i>Roger, roger, over.</i>

1572
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:30,333
<i>Come in, Tom and Jerry.</i>

1573
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,503
<i>I know you can't talk,
but I'm sure you can hear me.</i>

1574
01:26:32,569 --> 01:26:34,036
<i>Preeta's on Lexington,</i>

1575
01:26:34,103 --> 01:26:35,972
<i>and it looks like she's headed
for the Midtown Tunnel.</i>

1576
01:27:05,369 --> 01:27:06,969
<i>No, wait, they're actually
making a left turn on 57th.</i>

1577
01:27:07,036 --> 01:27:08,571
<i>They're going for
the Queensboro Bridge.</i>

1578
01:27:16,379 --> 01:27:17,813
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1579
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,148
<i>Guys, you have to get them</i>

1580
01:27:19,215 --> 01:27:20,284
<i>before they make it
to the bridge.</i>

1581
01:27:21,218 --> 01:27:22,520
<i>Hello?</i>

1582
01:27:22,585 --> 01:27:24,855
<i>Ugh, this no-talking thing
is really getting old.</i>

1583
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,328
Whoa!

1584
01:28:01,991 --> 01:28:02,859
Toots!

1585
01:28:08,598 --> 01:28:10,165
Stop the car!

1586
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:21,945
Follow them. Let's go.

1587
01:28:27,985 --> 01:28:28,884
Could you keep up?

1588
01:28:28,951 --> 01:28:30,119
<i>Great job, guys.</i>

1589
01:28:30,187 --> 01:28:31,955
<i>I'm sending you
a new location.</i>

1590
01:28:41,298 --> 01:28:43,067
Toots.

1591
01:28:43,566 --> 01:28:45,101
Come back!

1592
01:29:13,262 --> 01:29:15,598
What...
Kayla, what is going on?

1593
01:29:15,665 --> 01:29:17,066
Hear me out.

1594
01:29:17,133 --> 01:29:21,070
I know
yesterday was a disaster.

1595
01:29:21,137 --> 01:29:24,207
But I promise you
that most of the chaos

1596
01:29:24,275 --> 01:29:25,276
was because of me.

1597
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:27,378
And them.

1598
01:29:29,045 --> 01:29:32,883
But just like me,
they've changed their ways.

1599
01:29:35,886 --> 01:29:37,521
But, Preeta,

1600
01:29:37,587 --> 01:29:40,124
I really think we have
the chance to make this right.

1601
01:29:48,097 --> 01:29:49,766
Good luck.

1602
01:29:57,441 --> 01:29:58,976
Listen, Preeta, I'm sorry.

1603
01:29:59,043 --> 01:30:01,378
Okay? I wanted to give you
the wedding of your dreams,

1604
01:30:01,444 --> 01:30:03,647
but at some point,
it drifted into my dreams

1605
01:30:03,713 --> 01:30:04,914
and your father's dreams,

1606
01:30:04,981 --> 01:30:06,316
and then your father
was in my dreams,

1607
01:30:06,383 --> 01:30:08,018
and in one of them,
he was riding a tiger.

1608
01:30:08,084 --> 01:30:09,386
It was really weird.
And then...

1609
01:30:11,321 --> 01:30:14,557
I'm sorry that
I didn't just shut up

1610
01:30:14,624 --> 01:30:17,359
and listen to what you wanted.

1611
01:30:17,427 --> 01:30:18,763
What I want is you.

1612
01:30:20,562 --> 01:30:22,065
It's only ever been that.

1613
01:30:24,034 --> 01:30:25,201
Going forward,

1614
01:30:26,736 --> 01:30:29,206
I promise fewer surprises,

1615
01:30:29,938 --> 01:30:31,776
and I promise more truth.

1616
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:33,276
'Cause honestly,

1617
01:30:34,611 --> 01:30:35,512
I love you.

1618
01:30:37,112 --> 01:30:39,281
Will you please take this back?

1619
01:30:46,222 --> 01:30:49,025
And will you marry me again,
but better this time?

1620
01:31:26,562 --> 01:31:29,098
You know, it wasn't
all Thomas and Jerome.

1621
01:31:29,165 --> 01:31:31,167
I know you had
a hand in it, too.

1622
01:31:31,234 --> 01:31:32,335
You were right
from the beginning.

1623
01:31:32,402 --> 01:31:34,672
A resume
is just a piece of paper.

1624
01:31:34,737 --> 01:31:35,739
You have to give
someone a chance

1625
01:31:35,806 --> 01:31:36,839
to find out what they can do.

1626
01:31:36,906 --> 01:31:38,173
I agree.

1627
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,211
Yes, you, um,
did a very good job.

1628
01:31:41,945 --> 01:31:43,914
Thank you, Terence.

1629
01:31:43,981 --> 01:31:47,016
On that note,
I would love to introduce you

1630
01:31:47,083 --> 01:31:48,719
to Miss Linda Perrybottom.

1631
01:31:48,785 --> 01:31:49,819
Mr. Dubros.

1632
01:31:49,886 --> 01:31:51,722
The real owner of the resume.

1633
01:31:51,789 --> 01:31:52,989
Hello.

1634
01:31:53,056 --> 01:31:53,924
You must be Terence.

1635
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:55,190
Uh, I am.

1636
01:31:55,258 --> 01:31:56,927
Josephine Pennybaker
at the Dorsey

1637
01:31:56,993 --> 01:31:58,527
says the most wonderful things
about you.

1638
01:31:58,594 --> 01:31:59,495
Oh, she does?

1639
01:32:00,931 --> 01:32:02,900
It's quite
an impressive resume.

1640
01:32:03,834 --> 01:32:05,235
Um...

1641
01:32:05,301 --> 01:32:07,437
I guess I'll see you
in my office tomorrow, or,

1642
01:32:07,504 --> 01:32:11,508
um, in Mr. Dubros' office
tomorrow.

1643
01:32:18,414 --> 01:32:19,549
Thank you, Kayla.

1644
01:32:19,616 --> 01:32:21,618
And we'll see you tomorrow.

1645
01:32:21,683 --> 01:32:22,686
Thank you, sir.

1646
01:32:22,752 --> 01:32:24,120
And I won't let you down.

1647
01:32:24,855 --> 01:32:26,522
Good luck, Terence.

1648
01:32:38,935 --> 01:32:43,440
All right, I think we actually
might've pulled this off,

1649
01:32:43,507 --> 01:32:44,208
maybe.

1650
01:32:44,273 --> 01:32:45,942
Oh, definitely.

1651
01:32:47,544 --> 01:32:49,379
- Champagne.
- Mm-hmm.

1652
01:32:49,445 --> 01:32:50,279
Cheers.

1653
01:33:27,215 --> 01:33:29,084
Huh?

1654
01:33:35,825 --> 01:33:37,694
Come here, pussycat.

1655
01:33:37,761 --> 01:33:39,462
You're ruining the whole day.

1656
01:33:39,529 --> 01:33:43,299
I'm gonna
turn you into a biscuit.

1657
01:33:43,365 --> 01:33:45,401
Huh?

1658
01:33:50,106 --> 01:33:51,941
Sorry. Nothing to see here.

1659
01:33:52,008 --> 01:33:53,109
What the...

1660
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:44,160
<i>Maybach music...</i>

1661
01:40:34,009 --> 01:40:37,547
Uh, Mr. Dubros, I just
got a bill for both weddings.

1662
01:40:37,612 --> 01:40:38,714
That's a joke, right?

1663
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:40,115
Well, you know, I, uh,

1664
01:40:40,182 --> 01:40:42,819
had Terence run some numbers
earlier and...

1665
01:40:42,886 --> 01:40:44,487
it doesn't look good for you.

1666
01:40:47,757 --> 01:40:49,493
Thank you for choosing
the Royal Gate.

1667
01:40:54,707 --> 01:40:59,707
