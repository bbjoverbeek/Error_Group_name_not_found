1
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:54,819
<i>Once upon a time there
was a lovely princess.</i>

2
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:58,658
<i>But she had an enchantment
upon her of a fearful sort...</i>

3
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,618
<i>which could only be broken
by love's first kiss.</i>

4
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:06,038
<i>She was locked away
in a castle...</i>

5
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,339
<i>guarded by a terrible
fire-breathing dragon.</i>

6
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:14,798
<i>Many brave knights had attempted to
free her from this dreadful prison,</i>

7
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,628
<i>but none prevailed.</i>

8
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,889
<i>She waited in the dragon's
keep...</i>

9
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:22,889
<i>in the highest room of
the tallest tower...</i>

10
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:27,518
<i>for her true love and
true love's first kiss.</i>

11
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,559
Like that's ever gonna happen.

12
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:34,399
What a load of...

13
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:39,068
<i>Somebody once told me the
world is gonna roll me</i>

14
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,118
<i>I am not the sharpest
tool in the shed</i>

15
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:48,119
<i>She was looking kind of dumb
with her finger and her thumb</i>

16
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:51,919
<i>In the shape of an L
on her forehead</i>

17
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:54,919
<i>The years start coming and
they don't stop coming</i>

18
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:57,838
<i>Fed to the rules and
I hit the ground running</i>

19
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,179
<i>Didn't make sense not
to live for fun</i>

20
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:02,469
<i>Your brain gets smart but
your head gets dumb</i>

21
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,469
<i>So much to do, so much to see</i>

22
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:07,139
<i>So what's wrong with
taking the backstreets</i>

23
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,268
<i>You'll never know
if you don't go</i>

24
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,808
<i>You'll never shine
if you don't glow</i>

25
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,819
<i>Hey, now, you're an all-star</i>

26
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:16,278
<i>Get your game on, go play</i>

27
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:20,278
<i>Hey, now, you're a rock star,
get the show on, get paid</i>

28
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:24,328
<i>And all that glitters is gold</i>

29
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:29,828
<i>Only shooting stars
break the mould</i>

30
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,919
<i>It's a cool place and
they say it gets colder</i>

31
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:34,168
<i>You're bundled up now but
wait till you get older</i>

32
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:36,379
<i>But the meteor men
beg to differ</i>

33
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:38,379
<i>Judging by the hole in
the satellite picture</i>

34
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:41,178
<i>The ice we skate is
getting pretty thin</i>

35
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,298
<i>The water's getting warm
so you might as well swim</i>

36
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:45,219
<i>My world's on fire,
how about yours</i>

37
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:47,968
<i>That's the way I like it
and I'll never get bored</i>

38
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:50,689
<i>Hey, now, you're an all-star</i>

39
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,524
<i>Get your game on, go play</i>

40
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:57,569
<i>Hey, now, you're a rock star,
get the show on, get paid</i>

41
00:02:57,649 --> 00:03:01,359
<i>And all that glitters is gold</i>

42
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:06,369
<i>Only shooting stars
break the mould</i>

43
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,208
- Go!
- Go!

44
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:15,419
<i>Go. Go. Go.</i>

45
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:18,048
<i>Hey, now, you're an all-star</i>

46
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:21,218
<i>Get your game on, go play</i>

47
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:25,549
<i>Hey, now, you're a rock star,
get the show on, get paid</i>

48
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:29,518
<i>And all that glitters is gold</i>

49
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,899
<i>Only shooting stars
break the mould</i>

50
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:42,859
- Think it's in there?
- All right. Let's get it!

51
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:45,699
Whoa. Hold on. Do you know
what that thing can do to you?

52
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:48,739
Yeah, it'll grind your
bones for its bread.

53
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:52,788
Yes, well, actually,
that would be a giant.

54
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:56,919
Now, ogres...
they're much worse.

55
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,918
They'll make a suit from
your freshly peeled skin.

56
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,088
- No!
- They'll shave your liver.

57
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:05,429
Squeeze the jelly
from your eyes!

58
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:08,048
- Actually, it's quite good on toast.
- Back! Back, beast!

59
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:10,268
Back! I warn ya!

60
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:16,559
Right.

61
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:35,959
This is the part where
you run away.

62
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:45,799
And stay out!

63
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:50,759
Wanted. Fairy tale creatures.

64
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:58,649
All right. This one's full.

65
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:01,359
Take it away!

66
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:05,318
- Move it along. Come on! Get up!
- Next!

67
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:08,319
Give me that!
Your flying days are over.

68
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:11,029
That's 20 pieces of silver
for the witch. Next!

69
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:13,829
- Get up! Come on!
- Twenty pieces.

70
00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:16,288
Sit down there!

71
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:18,879
Keep quiet!

72
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,839
This cage is too small.

73
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,039
Please don't turn me in. I'll
never be stubborn again.

74
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,089
I can change. Please!
Give me another chance!

75
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:28,549
- Oh, shut up.
- Next!

76
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:31,509
- What have you got?
- This little wooden puppet.

77
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:36,519
I'm not a puppet.
I'm a real boy.

78
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:38,979
Five shillings for
the possessed toy.

79
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:41,149
- Take it away.
- Father, please! Don't let them do this!

80
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:43,149
- Next. What have you got?
- Help me!

81
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:45,859
Well, I've got a talking donkey.

82
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:50,488
Right. Well, that's good for ten
shillings, if you can prove it.

83
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:54,489
Oh, go ahead, little fella.

84
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:56,498
Well?

85
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,289
Oh, he's just...
he's just a little nervous.

86
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:03,339
He's really quite a chatterbox.
Talk, you bone headed dolt...

87
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,009
- That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
- No, no, he talks!

88
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:10,218
He does.
I can talk. I love to talk.

89
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:13,218
I'm the talkingest damn
thing you ever saw.

90
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:15,849
- Get her out of my sight.
- No, no!

91
00:06:15,928 --> 00:06:20,348
I swear! He can talk!

92
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:25,069
Hey! I can fly!

93
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,779
- He can fly!
- He can fly!

94
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:29,909
- He can talk!
- That's right, fool!

95
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:32,238
Now I'm a flying,
talking donkey.

96
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,948
You might have seen a house fly,
maybe even a super fly,

97
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,079
but I bet you ain't never
seen a donkey fly.

98
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,419
Seize him!

99
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:51,219
After him! He's getting away!

100
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:02,268
Get him! This way! Turn!

101
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,779
You there. Ogre!

102
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:12,158
Aye?

103
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:14,272
By the order of Lord
Farquaad, I am...

104
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:16,328
authorised to place you
both under arrest...

105
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:21,998
and transport you to a designated
resettlement facility.

106
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,129
Oh, really?
You and what army?

107
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,888
Can I say something to you?

108
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:42,308
Listen, you was really, really
something back there. Incredible!

109
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:47,106
Are you talking to me?

110
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:50,202
Yes, I was talking to you.
Can I just tell you

111
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:52,198
that you was great back there?
Those guards!

112
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,989
They thought they was all of that.
Then you showed up, and bam!

113
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,028
They was tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

114
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,039
That really made me
feel good to see that.

115
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:02,158
- Oh, that's great. Really.
- Man, it's good to be free.

116
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:07,789
Now, why don't you go celebrate your
freedom with your own friends? Hmm?

117
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,168
But I don't have any friends.

118
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:13,928
And I'm not going out
there by myself.

119
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:16,549
Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea!
I'll stick with you.

120
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:18,559
You're a mean, green,
fighting machine.

121
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:21,039
Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.

122
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:27,899
Oh, wow! That was
really scary.

123
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:29,821
If you don't mind me saying,
if that don't work,

124
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,689
your breath certainly
will get the job done,

125
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,988
'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs
or something, 'cause your breath stinks!

126
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:38,199
You almost burned the
hair outta my nose,

127
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,119
just like the time...

128
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:44,919
Then I ate some rotten berries. I had
strong gases eking out of my butt that day.

129
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:47,709
Why are you following me?

130
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:51,378
I'll tell you why.

131
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:54,378
<i>'Cause I'm all alone</i>

132
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:58,219
<i>There's no one here beside me</i>
